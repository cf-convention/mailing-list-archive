Dear Steve and John
<br />
<br />Apart from the point concerning the record dimension, which is specific to
<br />
netCDF, we have also made the argument that it is simpler to support only one
<br />
convention. The (n+1) convention, although it is the usual case, cannot deal
<br />
with non-contiguous or overlapping cells, both of which occur in practice (as
<br />
mentioned by Steve and Bob), so we have to support the (n,2) convention. This
<br />
convention is not difficult to write or use, just redundant in the contiguous
<br />
case, but that isn't a very serious issue, as Bob said.
<br />
<br />Steve remarked:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Note that N*M*nvertices is ambiguous with both respect to orientation
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (clockwise or no) and to starting &quot;corner&quot;.  The n*2m*2 encoding has no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ambiguities -- analogous to N*2.
</em><br />
<br />I don't think this is quite true, actually, because it cannot be guaranteed
<br />
that the data has been written so that the bounds are ordered in the same
<br />
sense as the coordinates. In one dimension, for instance, say
<br />
<br />x=1, 2, 3, 4;
<br />
bounds_x=1.5, 0.5,  2.5, 1.5,  3.5, 2.5,  4.5, 3.5;
<br />
<br />Even if we legislated against this, I don't think it could be depended upon not
<br />
to happen. To be robust, an application should assume nothing about the
<br />
ordering of the bounds, except that it is the same for all cells. But it's not
<br />
too hard to deal with in practice - just &quot;fussy&quot;, in Steve's word. In 2D, I
<br />
suppose you can compare two sets of vertices with unknown starting point and
<br />
ordering by doing something like sorting them in order of both coordinates
<br />
and then comparing the corresponding original indices.
<br />
<br />I think it is more sensible to put the burden of interpreting things on
<br />
the user of the data than the writer of it. That approach makes the convention
<br />
generally lightweight, more attractive and more likely to be adhered to. A
<br />
complicated standard can be broken more easily by accident. A standard which
<br />
is likely to be often broken is not useful to the user of the data.
<br />
<br />Bob said:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think the standard should prescribe one direction only, preferably
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; counterclockwise
</em><br />
<br />Of course, that would also make life easier for the user of the data, but I
<br />
fear that it is open to mistakes. The data-writer might have a different
<br />
interpretation of what counter-clockwise means (like left- and right-handed
<br />
rules for vectors), or simply get confused, and it's the kind of thing that
<br />
is terribly easy to get wrong (so I find, anyway).  Again, I would argue that
<br />
it is safer not to depend on it.
<br />
<br />We may choose to put the burden on the data-writer instead of on the user in
<br />
cases where the logic is potentially time-consuming to work out, which is the
<br />
main issue Steve raised wrt contiguousness. If I understand correctly, the
<br />
information to be recorded is, for each cell, which cells are adjacent.
<br />
Perhaps you also need to know which is their common edge. This kind of
<br />
information doesn't depend on any particular kind of grid. It can be supplied
<br />
even for unstructured grids dimensioned (cell). I agree with Bob that it
<br />
should be optional, as it *can* be worked out from the other information.
<br />
However, we might recommend including it for non-trivial grids (to be defined).
<br />
But as with all redundant information, should we worry about the possibility of
<br />
inconsistency?
<br />
<br />I would propose that if we want to record such information, it should be put
<br />
in data variables with specified standard names. For example:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;dimensions:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cell=7008;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maxneighbour=4;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;variables:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;float temperature(cell);
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;temperature:units=&quot;K&quot;;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;temperature:standard_name=&quot;air_temperature&quot;;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int neighbour(cell,maxneighbour);
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neighbour:standard_name=&quot;adjacent_cell_index&quot;;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neighbour:_FillValue=-1;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int commonedge(cell,maxneighbour);
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commonedge:standard_name=&quot;common_boundary_segment_index&quot;;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commonedge:_FillValue=-1;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;data:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neighbour=1, 96, -1, -1,   0, 2, 97, -1,  1, ...;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commonedge=1, 2, -1, -1,   3, 1, 2, -1,  3, ...;
<br />
<br />This would mean that cell 0 adjoins cells 1 and 96. Cell 1 adjoins cells 0, 2
<br />
and 97. The common edge between cells 0 and 1 is the one from vertex 1 to 2
<br />
of cell 0, and from vertex 3 to 0 of cell 1. (That is, I have assumed that an
<br />
edge is numbered by the vertex of lower index.)
<br />
<br />If we had had two dimensions (lat,lon) with lat=73 and lon=96 instead of a
<br />
single (cell) dimension, the information would be exactly the same. We have
<br />
already adopted a convention for numbering cells from 0, in section 8.2 on
<br />
compression by gathering.
<br />
<br />Information of this kind is almost within the description of section 7.2 on
<br />
cell measures:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; For some calculations, information is needed about the size, shape or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; location of the cells that cannot be deduced from the coordinates and bounds
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; without special knowledge that a generic application cannot be expected to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have.
</em><br />
<br />This isn't true because connectivity information *can* be deduced, but it is
<br />
complicated. Nonetheless, we could consider pointing to the neighbours and
<br />
common edges variables through the cell_measures attribute.
<br />
<br />Ths scheme has to allow a maxneighbour dimension as big as necessary, and hence
<br />
wastes space. But the convention of 8.2 could also be used to compress these
<br />
variables, eliminating the wasted space:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;dimensions:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cell=7008;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maxneighbour=4;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;adjacencies=27694;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;variables:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int adjacencies(adjacencies);
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;adjacencies:compress=&quot;cell maxneighbour&quot;;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int neighbour(adjacencies);
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neighbour:standard_name=&quot;adjacent_cell_index&quot;;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neighbour:_FillValue=-1;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int commonedge(adjacencies);
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commonedge:standard_name=&quot;common_boundary_segment_index&quot;;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commonedge:_FillValue=-1;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;data:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;adjacencies=0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, ...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;neighbour=1, 96, 0, 2, 97, 1, ...;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;commonedge=1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, ...;
<br />
<br />This means that neighbour(adjacencies) should be scattered into a 2D variable
<br />
(cell,maxneighbour), with the values of adjacencies(adjacencies) specifying
<br />
which cells of the 2D variables are populated, the rest being missing data.
<br />
<br />Would such a scheme be suitable?
<br />
<br />Cheers
<br />
<br />Jonathan
