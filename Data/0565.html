Hi Folks
<br />
<br />Apologies in advance. This will read like a criticism of the outstanding work 
<br />
that has and is being done. It is, but hopefully both minor and constructive, 
<br />
and the fact that I can do it at all is because of the outstanding start that 
<br />
we have with CF ... and again apologies, this is long.
<br />
<br />Ok, the subgrid variation.
<br />
<br />I think this is one of the examples of things that no one is quite sure of the 
<br />
status of now ...
<br />
<br />So, the issues this post raise are
<br />
<br />1) CF-1.0 was presumably frozen in place.  I can't find easily a place where 
<br />
all the proposals for CF-2.0 are collected separately. Whatever we decide to 
<br />
do, we should cleanly separate proposals from CF-1.0. (This is not a 
<br />
criticism of Brian or anyone else, this is hard to do, and takes time, so we 
<br />
need to a) want to do it, and b) resource it).
<br />
<br />2) The standard names.  Some of you will know that I think we need to address 
<br />
splitting CF into (at least) the following three components:
<br />
&nbsp;- vocabularies
<br />
&nbsp;- netcdf specific things
<br />
&nbsp;- other stuff.
<br />
<br />Having done that, we should separate the development track an possibly version 
<br />
each separately.  Anyway, limiting ourselves to vocabularies as they apply to 
<br />
variables and axes, as Jonathan and Steve both state, we have an issue with 
<br />
systemising modifiers (factorisation) of the standard names. We also have an 
<br />
issue with name proliferation (not in and of itself a problem, but a problem 
<br />
when we start to incorporate other namespaces and fixing them in place, e.g. 
<br />
selecting part of an external gazetteer, which then is evolves externally at 
<br />
a different pace).
<br />
<br />This is an area where there is a lot of work on in other communities, and we 
<br />
should look at what they are doing, and use it. In particular, GML has a 
<br />
dictionary concept. Can we use that as a starting point. Can we then ask how 
<br />
we use that in a CF compliant way? I think so, it could be as simple as 
<br />
referencing the namespace associated with a particular standard name. That 
<br />
would allow people to use externally maintained namespaces. For example:  the 
<br />
CF community are not the right people to maintain an atmospheric chemistry 
<br />
namespace, but we do want atmospheric chemistry in our CF compliant files ...
<br />
(Is this going to be a big change from CF-1.0? No, not if we do it right, it 
<br />
could even be backward compatible).
<br />
<br />3)  What about the modifiers issue? We need to come up with a method of 
<br />
dealing with modifiers of any sort in an abstract way, rather than creating 
<br />
epicycles every time we think of something new. OK, well, we're not going to 
<br />
do that today, so this should be something we put on our CF development 
<br />
track ...
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
On this specific proposal, if I quote 7.3 of CF-1.0:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Some methods (e.g., variance) imply a change of units of the variable, and 
<br />
this also is specified by Appendix D. &quot;
<br />
<br />Was anyone else aware that where we don't have a cell method we have to know a 
<br />
priori whether a quantity is extensive (depends on the size of the cell) or 
<br />
intensive (doesn't) to know what to with it. This makes perfect sense, except 
<br />
that this implies that all standard names need to have this as an attribute 
<br />
(or it is compulsory as an attribute of a variable, better but maybe even 
<br />
better to imply that things are intensive except when they have an attribute 
<br />
which says they're not). (Or do I have this all wrong?)
<br />
<br />Meanwhile, this will be a nightmare to *use*. 
<br />
<br />So, what do I think we should do? Clearly we need to keep the separation 
<br />
between vocabulary and usage (ie standard names and modifiers like cell 
<br />
methods). As Steve points out, this is broken already with cell methods, 
<br />
which can change the (implied/explicit) units of a standard name. I think we 
<br />
need to take a step back and ask ourselves how we can do this in a cleaner 
<br />
way. So this is another item of work we need for our CF development track ... 
<br />
<br />At that point, we probably should think about the structures of our standard 
<br />
names. My personal point of view would be that we should try and identify the 
<br />
semantic things we care about, and join them together into standard names.  
<br />
For example, we have x_sea_water_velocity as an alias of 
<br />
sea_water_x_velocity. I'd have to code every one of these up (but if we 
<br />
really do expand, then take for example the BODC parameter dictionary which 
<br />
has 10,000 entries, no way I'm going to do that manually)! Surely we can 
<br />
divide this into two or three semantic parts, and the order is irrelevant. 
<br />
Doing this could be as simple as stating that semantic content is separated 
<br />
by _ and order is irrelevant (but it wont be that simple :-). Roy Lowry has 
<br />
the wonderful example of how this can get out of hand: the advent of green 
<br />
dogs (if we allow colour modifiers to be completely independent of animals). 
<br />
I suppose our example could be orography velocity ... 
<br />
<br />I've got more thoughts on the standard names, but will save them for now, but 
<br />
by way of summary of this post, I think this email has raised three things we 
<br />
need to identify as needing more work, and for which we need someone to make 
<br />
a proposal about how to proceed.
<br />
<br />1) Versioning
<br />
2) Dealing with variable modifiers, units and standard names
<br />
3) Dealing with dictionaries of names, and relationship with external 
<br />
namespaces.
<br />
<br />We may need to decouple units and standard names to resolve these issues! 
<br />
Clearly we can't do that in CF 1.x, but we might in a future CF ...
<br />
<br />I'm deliberately not raising specific proposed solutions now, because what I 
<br />
would like us to do is identify that these are structural problems that need 
<br />
resolution in a future version of CF, not to be hacked into CF-1.0. Of course 
<br />
folk (including me) can come up with ways of dealing with it for now, but 
<br />
they wont be CF (standard).

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; They

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; are now creating files which have &quot;standard_name&quot; attributes.  In most
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; cases they lack cell_methods attributes.  They believe that they are

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; creating CF 1.0 compliant files.  Does your proposal  &quot;(2)&quot; imply that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; valid CF 1.0 files which use &quot;standard_name&quot; will become invalid CF 2.0
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; files?  If so isn't this a serious backwards compatibility concern?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, it would. Karl has also made that point. Strangely, Karl's posting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doesn't appear on the news archive.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree, we can only make cell_methods strongly recommended, rather than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mandatory, in order that previous CF files remain valid. I think that such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a recommendation is needed, because really people ought to record what they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intend a quantity to be, and when there is subgrid variation of surface
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; types, for instance, there is a real ambiguity. The standard name alone is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not sufficient metadata.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Before we introduce further complexity to the sub-grid cell_methods
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; machinery (which is not one of the more &quot;transparent&quot; aspects of CF
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; already), has there been a serious exploration of alternatives?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; I'm tempted to think that a thoughtful discussion on how to systematize
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; these modifiers is in order.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So far, I have not managed to think of better ways myself, and believe me,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I have spent hours thinking about it! But anyone's welcome to make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; proposals, of course. Yes, the standard_name and its modifiers and the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cell_methods together specify the quantity. This is a step towards some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;factorisation&quot; of the description, in order to limit the expansion of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; standard name table, and I think it's quite systematic. We are following a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; path between the extremes of putting all the definition in one attribute,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and breaking it down into many attributes.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Listening
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to the general community chatter there's no doubt that plenty of groups
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; have picked up the &quot;standard_name&quot; attribute and are thrilled to have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; found it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That is encouraging. Of course, it means we need to arrange ways of making
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it easier to add and modify standard names. That's something I hope we can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; discuss at the meeting at the GO-ESSP meeting at the BADC in June.
