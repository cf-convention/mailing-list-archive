Dear Brian and all
<br />
<br />I think that the main cause of discomfort is the issue of how to decide which
<br />
side of a cell might adjoin another cell if they are not actually contiguous.
<br />
I suppose that is why you proposed restricting (n,m,2,2) to cells that are
<br />
contiguous. However that strikes me as inconvenient because it means you have
<br />
to reconfigure the boundary information from (n,m,2,2) to (n,m,4) if you drop
<br />
a row or a column from the middle. Also, (n,m,2,2) is particularly useful if
<br />
the cells are *not* all contiguous, because it makes it easy to know which
<br />
boundaries to check for coincidence, provided you are prepared to accept that
<br />
cell (j,i) is &quot;next to&quot; cell (j,i-1) in some sense, etc. That's the problem
<br />
raised in the first sentence.
<br />
<br />I think that being &quot;next to&quot; really depends on the idea of an underlying xy
<br />
space in which the cells are actually arranged as a rectangular array. This is
<br />
not the case, for instance, for cells which are staggered on alternate rows
<br />
(like brickwork in a garden wall):
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*   *   *   *   *        These cells could be stored in an (n,m) array
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*   *   *   *   *      but they don't have an underlying coordinate
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*   *   *   *   *        variable x(m) because there are two sets of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*   *   *   *   *      values for x.
<br />
<br />In this arrangement it is ambiguous which cell might be regarded as next to a
<br />
cell vertically.
<br />
<br />I think we can distinguish the case where there is a rectangular xy
<br />
arrangement formally by saying continuous x(m) and y(n) coordinates exist.  By
<br />
continuous I mean they aren't just discrete indices. Continuous x and y exist
<br />
for map projections and a rotated pole, for example. Brian pointed out that
<br />
boundaries in x and y might not be stored so we can't use them to test
<br />
contiguousness. But if we know we do have the rectangular-xy case, we can
<br />
easily test contiguousness if we know which vertex is which. We don't have
<br />
to adopt (n,m,2,2) to be able to do that. We can do it just as well with
<br />
(n,m,4) if we define their ordering.
<br />
<br />So here is another alternative proposal. There's no change for the 1D case (1)
<br />
and (2). In this proposal I use (n,m,p) for all other cases (as in the present
<br />
CF standard), but when x and y exist, they are ordered in a particular way so
<br />
contiguousness is easy to test. The only drawback I can see is that you can't
<br />
guarantee the vertices are ordered anticlockwise in the lon-lat plane.
<br />
However, they are definitely ordered anticlockwise in the xy plane.
<br />
<br />By the way, I won't be at work from Sat 5th July for two weeks.
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
<br />
<br /><br />(3) In the case where the horizontal grid is described by two-dimensional
<br />
auxiliary coordinate variables in latitude lat(n,m) and longitude lon(n,m),
<br />
the associated cells are four-sided, and there exist continuous coordinate
<br />
variables x(m) and y(n), then the boundary variables are given in the form
<br />
latbnd(n,m,4) and lonbnd(n,m,4), where the trailing index runs over the four
<br />
vertices of the cells. Let us call the side of cell (j,i) facing cell (j,i-1)
<br />
the &quot;i-1&quot; side, the side facing cell (j,i+1) the &quot;i+1&quot; side, and similarly for
<br />
&quot;j-1&quot; and &quot;j+1&quot;. Then we can refer to the vertex formed by sides i-1 and j-1
<br />
as (j-1,i-1). With this notation, the four vertices are indexed as follows:
<br />
0=(j-1,i-1), 1=(j-1,i+1), 2=(j+1,i+1), 3=(j+1,i-1).
<br />
<br />If x-y-upward is a right-handed coordinate system (like lon-lat-upward), this
<br />
ordering means the vertices will be traversed anticlockwise on the lon-lat
<br />
surface seen from above. If x-y-upward is left-handed, they will be traversed
<br />
clockwise on the lon-lat surface.
<br />
<br />The bounds can be used to decide whether cells are contiguous, as follows:
<br />
<br />For 0 &lt; j &lt; n and 0 &lt; i &lt; m,
<br />
<br />If cells (j,i) and (j,i+1) are contiguous, then
<br />
<br />bnd(j,i,1)=bnd(j,i+1,0) and bnd(j,i,2)=bnd(j,i+1,3)
<br />
<br />If cells (j,i) and (j+1,i) are contiguous, then
<br />
<br />bnd(j,i,3)=bnd(j+1,i,0) and bnd(j,i,2)=bnd(j+1,i,1)
<br />
<br />(4) In all other cases, the bounds should be dimensioned (...,n,p), where
<br />
(...,n) are the dimensions of the auxiliary coordinate variables, and p the
<br />
number of vertices of the cells. The vertices must be traversed anticlockwise
<br />
in the lon-lat plane as viewed from above. The starting vertex is not
<br />
specified by the standard.
