<br />
Dear All
<br />
<br />I agree with Brian that if we include prefixes like &quot;error_on&quot; in the standard
<br />
name, we could end up with a tremendous number of standard names - it is quite
<br />
possible that every data variable could have a statistically derived standard
<br />
error, for instance. As Brian says, that is a reason why we record statistical
<br />
processing like &quot;mean&quot; and &quot;standard deviation&quot; in cell_methods rather than in
<br />
the standard name. Therefore I retract my suggestion we should distinguish
<br />
these error quantities through the standard name.
<br />
<br />The idea of making links between variables depends on the assumption that the
<br />
error variable can only exist in the company of the data variable it belongs
<br />
to, because the links are the identification of its role. This idea is like
<br />
bounds on coordinate variables, which are subsidiary to the coordinate
<br />
variables and have no attributes of their own. A problem with this, in my view,
<br />
is that we might choose to store the error variables apart from the variables
<br />
they belong to. I have come across situations, for instance, in which separate
<br />
files contained corresponding sets of variables, one file for the data values,
<br />
one for the measurement uncertainty, one for the data quality flags, etc.
<br />
Links between files would be require encoding filenames in files, which feels
<br />
unsafe to me. Moreover, since the link is on the main variable, if you look at
<br />
the standard error variable, for instance, you can't tell what its purpose is.
<br />
You can't even tell what it belongs to unless it has a link pointing back to
<br />
the main variable, as in Ag's example. Creating reverse links doubles the work
<br />
and the potential for things to go wrong.
<br />
<br />I tend to feel it is more reliable to identify a quantity by labelling it,
<br />
rather than by labelling something else to point to it. That's why I proposed
<br />
modifying the standard name. However, in view of the problem with that, perhaps
<br />
a better idea would be to put the extra information into a separate attribute
<br />
whose purpose is to indicate how this data variable affects the interpretation
<br />
of another data variable. For the sake of argument, call this attribute
<br />
&quot;intent&quot;. For example:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;float no2(time);
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no2:standard_name = &quot;nitrogen_dioxide_volume_mixing_ratio&quot; ; ### UNOFFICIAL
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no2:units = &quot;1-e9&quot; ;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;float no2_error_limit(time) ;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no2_error_limit:standard_name = &quot;nitrogen_dioxide_volume_mixing_ratio&quot;;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no2_error_limit:units = &quot;1-e9&quot; ;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no2_error_limit:intent = &quot;standard_error&quot; ;
<br />
<br />To find the standard error, you search the file, or files, for a data variable
<br />
with the same standard name (and other metadata, if necessary, to distinguish)
<br />
as the main variable and the appropriate intent attribute. This method means
<br />
the variables are all identifying themselves and carry around their own
<br />
metadata. There can be more than one kind of error variable for each data
<br />
variable - this presents no problem. By the way, how does the detection limit
<br />
differ from the standard error?
<br />
<br />The possible values of the intent attribute would be standardised and defined.
<br />
This is much like cell_methods. As with cell_methods, they might modify the
<br />
units implied by the standard name. For instance, a percentage error and a data
<br />
quality flag are dimensionless. Standardisation is necessary so that you know
<br />
what you've got. In Ag's example, it was a 2 * standard error that was
<br />
supplied. It is important to know whether it's once, twice, three times s.e.,
<br />
the width of the 5-95% confidence interval, or whatever. A generalisation of
<br />
the above is needed. We could define intents such as &quot;2_standard_errors&quot; or we
<br />
could have a further attribute e.g.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no2_error_limit:intent = &quot;standard_error&quot; ;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;no2_error_limit:error_multiplier=2.0;
<br />
<br />Another intent could be &quot;data_quality&quot;, the example given by John Evans. This
<br />
raises the interesting issue of how to describe what the possible values are.
<br />
John has recorded the values in special attributes e.g.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;current_speed_qc:standard_name=&quot;sea_water_speed&quot;;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;current_speed_qc:intent=&quot;data_quality&quot;;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;current_speed_qc:quality_good = 0b ;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;current_speed_qc:sensor_nonfunctional = 1b ;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;current_speed_qc:outside_valid_range = 2b ;
<br />
<br />This is nice because it makes the file self-describing, but is perhaps awkward
<br />
for translating from the values to their meanings? Also it would lead to
<br />
proliferation of different kinds of attribute.
<br />
<br />I guess it would be hopeless to try to define standard values or names for the
<br />
quality states, so the best we can do is to provide a standardised way of
<br />
tabulating what the quality states mean. What about gathering John's attributes
<br />
together in this kind of way:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;current_speed_qc:flag_values=0b, 1b, 2b;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;current_speed_qc:flag_meanings=&quot;quality_good sensor_nonfunctional &quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;outside_valid_range&quot;;
<br />
<br />where the values and their meanings are associated one-to-one? This would be
<br />
equally easy to use for translations either way, and would define just two
<br />
attributes which could be standardised, even though their values could not be.
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
