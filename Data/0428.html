Dear Roy
<br />
<br />Thanks for your question. Apologies for delay; I was away. Below is an attempt
<br />
at some answers. We could add these proposed standard names if you like.
<br />
<br />A general comment is that all of them have _in_sea_water appended. I know you
<br />
aren't happy with that, pointing out that it seems to exclude lakes and
<br />
rivers. I agree, that's a problem. The reason for having &quot;sea&quot; and not just
<br />
_in_water was because water is also found in the air as clouds! So I am not
<br />
sure what to do about this. Suggestions welcome.
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
<br />
<br /><br />I hadn't come across the terms &quot;vector irradiance&quot; and &quot;scalar irradiance&quot;
<br />
before (I'm no expert either). Searching on the web I find that the former
<br />
means what is usually called just &quot;irradiance&quot; or &quot;radiative flux density&quot; in
<br />
physics, and &quot;radiative flux&quot; in CF (since most people found that to be a more
<br />
familiar term). An irradiance is just an incident flux normal to the surface.
<br />
<br />Should we introduce &quot;scalar irradiance&quot; into standard names?  It's evidently a
<br />
common term in radiative transfer theory in the ocean, and appears to be
<br />
sometimes used for the atmosphere. However it's not very obvious to me what it
<br />
means; if I was allowed to choose a term, I'd call it &quot;spherical irradiance&quot;,
<br />
since it's the irradiance on a (hemi)spherical surface. I have found some
<br />
evidence for the existence of this term on the web!  What do you think?
<br />
<br /><br />downwelling vector irradiance:
<br />
<br />&quot;This is the measurement made by a cosine-collector light meter either as
<br />
discrete wavelength values or as an integral value from 300-700 nm termed
<br />
'PAR'.  Depending on instrument type it is expressed either as energy per unit
<br />
area or quanity of photons per unit area per unit time.&quot;
<br />
<br />The standard names and canonical units are as follows. * indicates standard
<br />
names that I have constructed here; we already have the ones without *.
<br />
<br />As a function of wavelength expressed in energy units
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;downwelling_spectral_radiative_flux_in_sea_water (W m-2 m-1)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;surface_downwelling_spectral_radiative_flux_in_sea_water
<br />
PAR expressed in energy units
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;*downwelling_photosynthetic_radiative_flux_in_sea_water (W m-2)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;*surface_downwelling_photosynthetic_radiative_flux_in_sea_water
<br />
As a function of wavelength expressed as a photon flux
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;*downwelling_spectral_photon_flux_in_sea_water (mol m-2 s-1 m-1)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;*surface_downwelling_spectral_photon_flux_in_sea_water
<br />
PAR expressed as a photon flux
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;downwelling_photosynthetic_photon_flux_in_sea_water (mol m-2 s-1)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;surface_downwelling_photosynthetic_photon_flux_in_sea_water
<br />
<br />The spectral ones should have a coordinate of radiation_wavelength (m) to
<br />
state the wavelength. As a more precise alternative to the PAR quantities, you
<br />
could give them as
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;*downwelling_radiative_flux_in_sea_water (W m-2)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;*surface_downwelling_radiative_flux_in_sea_water
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;*downwelling_photon_flux_in_sea_water (mol m-2 s-1)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;*surface_downwelling_photon_flux_in_sea_water
<br />
with a radiation_wavelength coordinate having bounds of 300 and 700 nm.
<br />
<br /><br />downwelling scalar irradiance:
<br />
<br />&quot;This is the measurement made by a hemispherical collector (sometimes termed
<br />
2-pi).  Again I have discrete wavelength, PAR and data as energy/photons.&quot;
<br />
<br />The standard names for energy units would be as above with radiative_flux
<br />
replaced by spherical_irradiance (or scalar_irradiance).
<br />
<br />On the web the only term I can find for the corresponding photon flux is
<br />
&quot;photon fluence rate&quot;, but that doesn't appear common in oceanography.  There
<br />
is no evidence for a term &quot;scalar photon flux&quot;. Therefore I would propose
<br />
names as above with photon_flux replaced by photon_spherical_irradiance, since
<br />
the term &quot;photon irradiance&quot; does appear to exist.
<br />
<br />None of these standard names currently exist.
<br />
<br /><br />downwelling radiance:
<br />
<br />&quot;This is the measurement made by a light sensor at the bottom of a tube. Again
<br />
I have discrete wavelength, PAR and data as energy/photons.&quot;
<br />
<br />The difference between radiance and irradiance (i.e. flux) is that radiance
<br />
specifies a direction and is expressed per unit solid angle, so the units all
<br />
have sr-1 added. The standard names would be as in the first set with
<br />
radiative_flux replaced by radiance and photon_flux by photon_radiance, which
<br />
is a term that appears to exist on the web.
<br />
<br />None of these standard names currently exist.
