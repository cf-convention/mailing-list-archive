Dear Steve
<br />
<br />Thanks for your email on the future development of CF. I agree, this is an
<br />
important issue. I think we have to do two things:
<br />
<br />* Use whatever personal contacts we have to encourage people to consider using
<br />
CF, and to express their needs for development via this email list. I believe
<br />
that we are all trying to do this. It concerns me, like you, that there are
<br />
only 20 subscribers currently. I agree with John that we should readvertise CF
<br />
regularly on the netcdfgroup. Probably every new release could be advertised,
<br />
and the first non-beta release, coming soon, will be a good occasion.
<br />
<br />* Use this email list to discuss how to proceed as an open forum. The archive
<br />
then serves as a record of how decisions were made - a concern you expressed in
<br />
an earlier message.
<br />
<br />The growing interest is encouraging. To the list you give, I would add that
<br />
several climate centres are interested, the Working Group on Coupled Models
<br />
(a WMO committee) supports our efforts, and IGBP will consider whether CF
<br />
would be appropriate for their proposed Earth System Atlas.
<br />
<br />I agree that we should do whatever we can to avoid the standard fragmenting into
<br />
local conventions. Some such agreements may be unavoidable, but in the first
<br />
place we must consider whether general solutions could be adopted in the
<br />
standard. Of course, this takes time. It is harder to think about whether a
<br />
particular idea has greater applicability and to frame some appropriate
<br />
solution than it is to work out a simple addition that will deal with your own
<br />
specific problem. I will make that point on the PRISM mailing list.
<br />
<br />I don't think we should put in place any more procedures until we need them,
<br />
because bureaucracy slows things down. We have made a lot of progress so far
<br />
by focussing on what we actually need. But now CF is being adopted in practice,
<br />
we obviously have to make sure decisions are properly debated.
<br />
<br />One reason why we might need more procedures is if decisions cannot be made by
<br />
a discussion of everyone fast enough, because people cannot make enough time to
<br />
think about it. In fact this has always been a problem, as you know. It becomes
<br />
more serious as the standard includes things which require more expertise to
<br />
understand. People will then either have to make time to learn about the new
<br />
issues, or accept decisions made by consensus. We could introduce web documents
<br />
recording &quot;requests/proposals for development&quot;. To some extent this would
<br />
duplicate the email list, but I suppose that such documents would try to remain
<br />
short, and would evolve to summarise the results of discussions, until there
<br />
was agreement on what would go into the standard.
<br />
<br />Cheers
<br />
<br />Jonathan
<br />
