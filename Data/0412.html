Continuing on the same subject ...
<br />
<br />Could I emphasise first that I agree that something needs to be done, as we
<br />
want to add many parameters to the table, and the current arrangements will not
<br />
be able to deal with it.
<br />
<br />With regard to Steve's comment about mistakes, I agree, and we already have a
<br />
means to do that. The &quot;alias&quot; entry in the standard name xml is a way to link
<br />
an old name for a quantity to its new name, and we have used it several times.
<br />
<br />I'd like to make this proposal, an elaboration of what I wrote before:
<br />
<br />(0) We retain the existing arrangement for adding standard name as proposed to
<br />
the email list, which should be adequate in many cases involving only a few
<br />
new standard names.
<br />
<br />(1) Projects wanting to develop their own list of standard names should produce
<br />
xml tables with the same schema as the central table (containing standard name,
<br />
canonical units, description).
<br />
<br />(2) Each such project should have a unique name, and the project tables should
<br />
be linked with those names from the CF home page (like conventions of netCDF).
<br />
That means the project tables will all be public.
<br />
<br />(3) Project tables should avoid including new names for quantities which already
<br />
have standard names in the central tables or in any of the existing project
<br />
tables.
<br />
<br />(4) Names in the project table which are not in the central table should have
<br />
a prefix of the name of the project which defined them. One possible syntax
<br />
would be, for instance, &quot;my_project/my_standard_name&quot;. There would be no need
<br />
for an attribute in the netCDF file to identify the standard name table, as
<br />
the project name will refer to a table which is linked from the CF
<br />
website. That makes the files more &quot;future-proof&quot; (since URLs often change).
<br />
<br />(5) When names are adopted from project tables into the central table, with or
<br />
without changes, an alias will be made to the name in the project table i.e.
<br />
if a central standard name of new_standard_name is defined for the quantity
<br />
which was named my_project/my_standard_name, the latter will become an alias of
<br />
the former in the central table.
<br />
<br />(6) Maintainers of project tables should consider deleting or updating entries
<br />
which have been given names in the central table.
<br />
<br />This would allow projects to do their own thing, but also means that we can
<br />
continue to consider how to incorporate new lists into the central table.
<br />
<br />An existing example something rather like this is the aquaplanet experiment
<br />
(APE). APE defined ape_names for its quantities. Most, but not all, of them are
<br />
standard names. (See <a href="http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/amip/ape/ape_data_specs.html">http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/amip/ape/ape_data_specs.html</a>.)
<br />
If we had a policy like the above, we should now be thinking about defining
<br />
central standard names for those ape_names which don't have them. One example
<br />
is &quot;Zonal velocity tendency - Gravity Wave Drag&quot;. We could easily define a
<br />
standard name for that, following existing guidelines. The problem is (this is
<br />
not a criticism of APE in particular) that there is no impetus or effort to do
<br />
so. Hence it is perfectly possible that another project may choose their own
<br />
local name for this quantity. Then we will have two names for it, which will
<br />
be a problem for users of data from both. The original point of standard names
<br />
was to avoid this, by not permitting there to be alternative names. What can
<br />
we do to stop it happening?
<br />
<br />Finally, there is a possibility that names might be defined which don't
<br />
conform to CF, especially if the names include information which belongs in
<br />
cell_methods (e.g. time-mean) or coordinates (e.g. 10 m above the ground).
<br />
How would that be checked?
<br />
<br />Cheers
<br />
<br />Jonathan
