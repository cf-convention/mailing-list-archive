Nan/Jonathan,
<br />
<br />Following our discussions at IMDIS/GO-ESSP I think the OTS is an area
<br />
where we need to look carefully at the role of the BODC Parameter Usage
<br />
Vocabulary in the CF standard.
<br />
<br />I think Jonathan's suggestion of extending the Standard Names to cover
<br />
the requirements of OTS goes against the idea we had at GO-ESSP to avoid
<br />
increasing the area of overlap between the two vocabularies.  
<br />
<br />What I think we need in OTS is a mechanism to link to either vocabulary
<br />
or perferably both.  My suggestion would be for a field somewhere in the
<br />
standard to locate the 8-byte BODC parameter code with an option to use
<br />
the full_title term from the vocabulary for the CF long name.  This
<br />
would allow the data originators - ie those who know their data best -
<br />
to establish the vocabulary mapping.  
<br />
<br />The weakness with this is that the structure implies the relationship:
<br />
<br />BODC Parameter Usage Vocabulary term = (ie is exactly the same as) CF
<br />
Standard Name term
<br />
<br />It is glaringly obvious to anyone who has looked at the vocabularies in
<br />
any detail that this such perfect correspondance is far from universal. 
<br />
What we really need if we have terms from the two vocabularies
<br />
describing the same variable is a standardised statement of how these
<br />
descriptions relate to each other based on OWL or something more
<br />
restrictive (but specifically targetted at the problem) like SKOS.
<br />
<br />Cheers, Roy.

<br />
Thanks for bringing OTS into the discussion, Steve, and thanks for your
<br />
<br />comments
<br />
Jonathan.
<br />
<br />Our operational data is so much simpler than that of some other CF
<br />
users 
<br />
that it
<br />
sometimes seems we don't exactly fit here, but the CF community and 
<br />
resources
<br />
have been really helpful,  and your standard was the obvious choice for
<br />
<br />our data.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; But instead they could be CF-compliant by dimensioning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the data variable as (time,depth) and giving it a coordinates
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attribute to point to auxiliary coordinate variables of lat(time)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and lon(time).... These are what CF calls &quot;scalar coordinate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; variables&quot; and they avoid introducing a size-one dimension
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just to attach coordinate info.
</em><br />
<br />Maybe I didn't think this through well enough, or I completely missed 
<br />
one of
<br />
the basic CF concepts. I somehow missed that CF files should &quot;avoid 
<br />
introducing
<br />
a size-one dimension just to attach coordinate info&quot; and thought that 4
<br />
<br />dimensions was
<br />
a reasonable way to go, as it gives you the overall size of the dataset
<br />
<br />in one query.
<br />
For mooring data, this seems to make perfect sense, or maybe I just 
<br />
expect it because
<br />
it was standard in our old NetCDF implementation, EPIC.
<br />
<br />We have not ruled out files containing data from more than one platform
<br />
<br />- as we
<br />
sometimes deploy arrays of sensors. Such  a file would have lat/lon 
<br />
dimensions &gt; 1,
<br />
in all other files these dimensions would be 1.  This does lead to a 
<br />
problem with drifters,
<br />
where the X and Y dimensions of the measured parameters are 1 but lat 
<br />
and long are
<br />
of dimension T.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; CF provides a method to attach quality-control info to data
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; variables, which OTS could extend to meet their needs in this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; area (CF 3.4).
</em><br />
<br />The CF scheme for QC might help us give the different data providers 
<br />
more flexibility
<br />
than having a defined table as we currently do. The down side is that
<br />
if 
<br />
the flag_meanings
<br />
are not defined as part of the standard, they can't be interpreted by 
<br />
software; I'm not
<br />
sure how CF users implement this.
<br />
<br />We also have some data sets (mine, for instance) where QC information
<br />
is 
<br />
more
<br />
logically supplied as an attribute, because the data is interpolated 
<br />
over time to correct
<br />
clock drift after initial QC procedures. The original individual points
<br />
<br />are gone,
<br />
and point-specific QC becomes meaningless.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; They probably would like some additions to the standard
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; name table.
</em><br />
<br />I haven't had a problem finding standard names for our parameters yet.
<br />
I'm
<br />
still hoping the udunits system will at some point include conductivity
<br />
and
<br />
salinity units other than 1, though. Meanwhile I'm dealing with this
<br />
by
<br />
specifying CF-compliant &quot;units&quot;  and &quot;text_units&quot; that are useful for
<br />
labels
<br />
and don't have to be accepted by udunits.
<br />
<br />Cheers - Nan
