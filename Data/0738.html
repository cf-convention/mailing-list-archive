<br />
I've noticed I sent this (on 15 Aug) to Michael only, not the CF list.
<br />
<br />Dear Michael
<br />
<br />Sorry for the delay. I was busy with another urgent task (IPCC report first
<br />
draft).
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
We agree on these:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  * partial_pressure_of_carbon_dioxide_in_air:Pa
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  * partial_pressure_of_carbon_dioxide_in_sea_water:Pa
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  * speed_of_sound_in_sea_water:m s-1
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  * height_above_sea_floor:m
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  * volume_absorption_coefficient_of_radiation_in_sea_water:m-1
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  * volume_attenuation_coefficient_of_radiation_in_sea_water:m-1
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  * volume_scattering_function_of_radiation_in_sea_water:m-1 sr-1
</em><br />
<br />Following Roy's points (1) I presume that the absorption and attenuation are
<br />
integrals over all wavelengths, unless there is a coordinate variable
<br />
specifying range(s) of wavelengths (2) scattering function is scattering due
<br />
to all scatterers.
<br />
<br />I'm putting the &quot;platform&quot; business in a separate email.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you accept (and interpret as I do) the NIST SI Unit rules and style
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; conventions (<a href="http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/checklist.html">http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/checklist.html</a>) #22, which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mentions molality, then we also agree on the following:
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;  * molality_of_oxygen_in_sea_water:mol kg-1 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  * molality_of_nitrate_in_sea_water:mol kg-1 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  * molality_of_phosphate_in_sea_water:mol kg-1 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  * molality_of_silicate_in_sea_water:mol kg-1
</em><br />
<br />I don't disagree that these are acceptable and conventional terms, but
<br />
although we should depart from common usage only with care, I'd repeat that I
<br />
don't think they are ideal terms. I'm using only my own ignorance as a guide,
<br />
but I suspect that &quot;molality&quot; isn't a term that most climate modellers would
<br />
be sure about, for example, but yet they may well come across these quantities
<br />
in the output of their ocean models soon. People may have heard of &quot;molarity&quot;;
<br />
the similarity between these terms is another source of confusion. It's pretty
<br />
difficult even to pronounce &quot;molarity&quot; and &quot;molality&quot; distinctly! Therefore I
<br />
would propose the more cumbersome but explicit &quot;moles_of_oxygen_per_unit_
<br />
mass_in_sea_water&quot; etc. instead of &quot;molality&quot;. What do you think?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; You had proposed &quot;Omnidirectional spherical irradiance&quot; for 4-pi spherical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or &quot;scalar&quot; irradiance. The ocean optics literature tends to use the word
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;total&quot;, rather than &quot;omnidirectional&quot; to indicate a 4-pi measurement.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Incidentally, such a 4-pi measurement is often the sum of upwelling and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; downwelling 2-pi spherical irradiances, where the difference (downwelling
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; minus upwelling) is called &quot;net downward&quot;, and which is already used in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; CF convention.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So rather than:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; omnidirectional_photosynthetic_spherical_irradiance_in_sea_water:W m-2
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; omnidirectional_spectral_spherical_irradiance_in_sea_water:W m-3
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would like to propose:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; total_photosynthetic_spherical_irradiance_in_sea_water:W m-2
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; total_spectral_spherical_irradiance_in_sea_water:W m-3
</em><br />
<br />Again while not common usage, I still prefer my &quot;omnidirectional&quot;. That is
<br />
because it says what it means, whereas &quot;total&quot; does not. You would have to
<br />
know what the other possibilities are to understand &quot;total&quot;. In fact the same
<br />
issue arises with the plane irradiance quantities that you mention. In common
<br />
usage, &quot;total downward&quot; is sometimes contrasted with &quot;net downward&quot;, or just
<br />
&quot;downward&quot; (understood to mean &quot;net&quot;). But this is also unclear, so we adopted
<br />
&quot;downwelling&quot; instead of &quot;total downward&quot;, and we do not have any name which
<br />
says just &quot;downward&quot; radiation; it has to be &quot;downwelling&quot; or &quot;net downward&quot;,
<br />
to leave minimal possibility for misinterpretation by people not experts in
<br />
the domain. The point of standard names is that they facilitate exchange of
<br />
information, and hence they have to be comprehensible by as wide a group of
<br />
potential users as possible.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; For my proposed backscattering variable, you had suggested using just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;scattering&quot; rather than &quot;back-scattering&quot;, and wondered if &quot;back&quot; was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; important.  I would have to that &quot;back&quot; is indeed important, since the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; majority of scattering measurements are either 1)backscatter 2)small-angle
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; forward scattering, or 3)difference of attenuation and absorption, and while
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; any of the three measurement techniques -can- be scaled to estimate total
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; scattering, the calculations are generally not performed because they are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; very approximate, and the resulting total scattering values are not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comparable across techniques.  Hence, I'd like to stick with:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  * volume_backscattering_coefficient_of_radiation_in_sea_water:m-1
</em><br />
<br />I think this indicates I don't know what &quot;scattering&quot; means to you, so I
<br />
couldn't write a proper definition of it. I assumed that &quot;scattering&quot; means
<br />
that part of attenuation which isn't due to absorption. The angle into which
<br />
the scattering occurs is not relevant to the attenuation. I assumed
<br />
&quot;back-scattering&quot; was scattering into particular range of angles (those which
<br />
are nearly opposite to the incident beam). Is that what you mean? If so, your
<br />
back-scattering coefficient is an integral of the scattering function over
<br />
that range of angles, which ought to be defined (as a coordinate, I imagine),
<br />
and is a small part of the scattering coefficient. I'd prefer to give it a
<br />
more generic term indicating that's what it is. Your practical distinction is
<br />
in terms of measurement techniques, but CF names describe the physical
<br />
quantities measured, so as to make them comparable for data from different
<br />
sources (models and observations, particularly).
<br />
<br />On this subject, we need a convention for the angle in the scattering
<br />
function. I assume it is the opening angle between the incident beam and the
<br />
scattered beam, pi for backward scattering. Is that right?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Also, you mentioned that you didn't understand the comments about being
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;relative to air or pure water&quot;.  The issue is how 'zero' is defined, and is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; somewhat of a calibration issue -- &quot;relative to air&quot; is essentially
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;relative to nothing&quot;, so I prefer it.
</em><br />
<br />Well, indeed. I assumed the coefficients were defined in absolute terms,
<br />
telling you how much attenuation there is. Zero means no attenuation. That
<br />
doesn't seem relative to anything, or it's relative to nothing if you like!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; sea_water_bioluminescent_photon_rate:s-1 m-3
</em><br />
How about
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;bioluminescent_photon_rate_in_sea_water:s-1 m-3
<br />
to use the usual &quot;in_MEDIUM&quot; convention.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; sea_water_dissolved_oxygen_saturation:1
</em><br />
How about
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;fractional_saturation_of_oxygen_in_sea_water:1
<br />
for similar reasons. Is &quot;dissolved&quot; important? It is assumed in other cases
<br />
such as the mol kg-1 names. I think it is probably obvious in the context of
<br />
&quot;saturation&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; sea_water_dissolved_oxygen_volume_fraction:1
</em><br />
I tend to think &quot;volume fraction&quot; is puzzling in this term, since once it's
<br />
dissolved it doesn't really occupy a volume of the sea water. How about
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;volume_mixing_ratio_of_oxygen_in_sea_water:1
<br />
which (like mass mixing ratios) might more obviously refer to the volume it
<br />
had before mixing. There must be a convention for the measurement of that
<br />
original volume. Is it STP? If so we could insert &quot;at_stp&quot; after oxygen. We
<br />
have used that before.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Regarding (surface_carbon_dioxide_partial_pressure_anomaly:1), 'anomaly'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indicates the difference between air and water carbon dioxide partial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pressure.  I see that this is different than how anomaly is used for all the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; other CF variables, so how about:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; surface_carbon_dioxide_partial_pressure_difference:Pa
</em><br />
<br />This is a headache. It's the difference between two quantities and we could
<br />
name it as such, but that would be very lengthy. I think it would be clear
<br />
if we had yours with &quot;between_sea_water_and_air&quot; on the end, but would even
<br />
that be too lengthy? This is a routinely recorded quantity, presumably?
<br />
<br />Since you put &quot;surface&quot; here, do you also want it on the other two partial
<br />
pressure names?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; water_volume_transport:m3 s-1
</em><br />
I suppose that should be sea_water_volume_transport, given the application.
<br />
Flows through estuaries and through instruments are very different, and it
<br />
seems odd to give them the same name! The former is something that should
<br />
have a standard name, although it would often need geographical definition.
<br />
When you use the latter, how do you associate it with other quantities?
<br />
<br />Thanks for your help. Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
