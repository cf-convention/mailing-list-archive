Hi All,
<br />
<br />Certainly many ocean and atmospheric modelers don't pay attention to the 
<br />
shape of the earth beneath their models.  My view of the importance of 
<br />
the CF standards is allowing people to use other people's work to make 
<br />
&quot;value added&quot; products.  To that end, the user needs to be able to 
<br />
figure out where on the planet a point is from someone's model.  We 
<br />
could certainly express a &quot;user beware&quot; policy with respect to geoid 
<br />
given (lat, long), and have GIS users that cannot convert on the fly to 
<br />
do their own conversion at their own risk. 
<br />
<br />We should have the metadata standards set up so that caring modelers can 
<br />
express their geoids correctly, and maybe the others could identify 
<br />
their models as &quot;not GIS compatible&quot; or we'll assume the &quot;user beware&quot;.  
<br />
The providers most interested in getting their products used will be 
<br />
most interested in small details.
<br />
<br />I work with the NOAA Office of Response and Restoration.  We do response 
<br />
in navigable waters for oil and chemical spills, airline disasters and 
<br />
things like that.  One of our goals is to be able to use more than just 
<br />
our own circulation models within our trajectory model, GNOME. So we are 
<br />
working to develop GNOME as a grid independent application. 
<br />
(<a href="http://response.restoration.noaa.gov/software/gnome/gnome.html">http://response.restoration.noaa.gov/software/gnome/gnome.html</a> though 
<br />
the capabilities I'm talking about are in Diagnostic Mode)
<br />
To that end, the CF standards are critically important.  Developing our 
<br />
model to understand any circulation model on its native grids using the 
<br />
CF metadata standards means that we could meet our response timelines 
<br />
with outside data.  Our office works 24 x 7, providing a verbal 
<br />
description of how the incident is expected to unfold within 30 min of 
<br />
notification, and producing any needed model derived forecasts within 2 
<br />
hours of notification.  Mostly we respond to incidents within the US or 
<br />
her territories, but we do at times get involved internationally. So, we 
<br />
can't be messing around with format conversions at all. 
<br />
<br />Getting the coordinates correct is important:
<br />
-- if you are going to send someone out to look for something
<br />
-- if you care where something contacts the shoreline (calculating 
<br />
beaching correctly is a big issue for us.)
<br />
-- if you are going to overlay the trajectory with the location of 
<br />
resources as risk (most often represented in GIS systems).
<br />
<br />As I said above, even if most modelers aren't going to pay attention to 
<br />
their geoid, the wind and water modelers that want their 
<br />
nowcasts/forecasts used for emergency response will pay attention to 
<br />
details like geoid.  So we should have the metadata standards thought 
<br />
out and ready for them.  NOAA/ORR is increasingly working with the IOOS 
<br />
Regional Associations on how to set up model connectivity between our 
<br />
office and their models.  Being able to point to the CF standards may be 
<br />
more important in saving the world a piece at a time than you think.
<br />
<br />-CJ

&gt;&gt;&gt; The data provider probably doesn't care very much. This information 
&gt;&gt;&gt; is not
&gt;&gt;&gt; seen as critical for interpretation or even formulation of the 
&gt;&gt;&gt; model. Hence
&gt;&gt;&gt; you can probably legitimately serve it using any reasonable assumption.
&gt;&gt;&gt;   
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I would go even further than this. While it is possible that the 
&gt;&gt; coordinate transformation error becomes more significant at very high 
&gt;&gt; resolution global models and mesoscale model scales, the actual 
&gt;&gt; significance of the model results at those scales is poor (typically, 
&gt;&gt; for a grid point model, one should be looking at an effective 
&gt;&gt; resolution about four times the grid resolution).  What that means is 
&gt;&gt; the error in the grid projection transformation (if there is one) is 
&gt;&gt; vastly smaller than the effective grid registration (ie. how 
&gt;&gt; accurately the model coordinates reflect the real world). This is 
&gt;&gt; probably true even in a data assimilation model, where the model 
&gt;&gt; knows a bit more about the real world ...
&gt;&gt; Nowcasting models at the very finest scales may be a different story, 
&gt;&gt; but in that case the grid formulation should probably be rather 
&gt;&gt; different than a global spherical formulation ...  (&quot;should&quot; I say, 
&gt;&gt; don't know that they are :-)
&gt;&gt;  
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; I don't think that CF can cope with everything ...
&gt;&gt;  
&gt;&gt;
&gt; Well, Mr Toyoda has shown that the difference between geodetic 
&gt; (ellipsoidal earth) and geocentric (spherical earth) latitude is 
&gt; around 20 km at mid-latitude.  My understanding of the conversation is 
&gt; that we should assume spherical earth for global models, unless 
&gt; otherwise stated. Now when I send that info to a GIS package that uses 
&gt; an ellipsoidal earth, presumably they will correct the coordinates to 
&gt; take this into account.
&gt;
&gt; Now for models that do have accuracy in which 20 km matters, they will 
&gt; need to record information as to earth shape in order to get correct 
&gt; geolocation. Perhaps there are no such models yet (??) but someday 
&gt; there may be.
&gt;
&gt; If CF doesnt want to cope with this, it would be helpful if CF stated 
&gt; that the scope of its mission is to deal with model data with 
&gt; resolution greater than such and such.
&gt;
&gt; Another possibility would be to create an extension of CF for model 
&gt; data with resolution less than such and such.
&gt;
&gt; Perhaps these are issues to be discussed at the GO-ESSP conference?
&gt;
&gt; In any case, I really appreciate everyone's help in responding to this 
&gt; question, and in everyone's thoughts about what CF should do.
