Dear Bob and Brian
<br />
<br />Thanks for your responses. Evidently rectilinear is a confusing term to use, as
<br />
you both indicate. I agree we should avoid it altogether.
<br />
<br />To be clearer, the case I wanted to distinguish is the one where there are
<br />
2D lat and lon coordinates and, in addition, where the 2D grid indicates the
<br />
adjacencies of the cells: for 0&lt;i&lt;x and all j, cell (j,i-1) and cell (j,i)
<br />
are adjacent (not necessarily contiguous, but there is no intervening cell)
<br />
and for 0&lt;j&lt;y and all i, cell (j,i) and cell (j-1,i) are adjacent. In the
<br />
other case, the cells might be in an array of any dimensionality, whose
<br />
indices don't easily tell you about their adjacencies. In many cases they
<br />
may be in a 1D array. However, a 2D array doesn't necessarily tell you which
<br />
cells are adjacent. Suppose, for example, you covered the plane with hexagons
<br />
and gave each hexagon an index, then subdivided the hexagons into six
<br />
equilateral triangles and gave each triangle an index within its hexagon.
<br />
You then have a 2D array but cells (hexagon,triangle) and (hexagon-1,triangle)
<br />
are probably not adjacent. Furthermore the hexagons themselves might be viewed
<br />
as a 2D array in which case the cells are in a 3D array even though they cover
<br />
a 2D plane.
<br />
<br />Is that clear? This distinction matters precisely because in the former case
<br />
you can decide contiguousness with no special knowledge about the x-y grid.
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From the current draft of the CF document, I wonder if we can call these cases
</em><br />
Cartesian and non-Cartesian?
<br />
<br />I think Brian is right about the 2D contiguousness checking. In the case he
<br />
describes, if there is a hole between i and i+1, say, for some range of j but
<br />
not all j, it is clear there cannot possibly exist a continuous x coordinate,
<br />
because no reasonable continuous transformation will map coincident points in
<br />
x and y at the boundary between i and i+1 to separated points in lat and lon on
<br />
opposite sides of the hole. Hence we should recommend that if x and y coords
<br />
do exist, their boundaries should be supplied, because this indicates there
<br />
*is* a continuous transformation, and contiguousness can then be checked in 1D.
<br />
We could point this out in second-last paragraph of the preamble of section 5.
<br />
<br />If x and y coordinates do not exist, x and y are just index dimensions
<br />
and there will be no grid_mapping variable - it couldn't be one of the cases
<br />
we have described (polar stereographic, rotated pole, etc.) as these are all
<br />
continuous transformations, but one in which lat and lon and their bounds are
<br />
essentially arbitrary functions of the x and y indices.
<br />
<br />Here are the proposals again with modified terminology.
<br />
<br />Jonathan
<br />
<br />(1) For a 1D coordinate variable with bounds (x,2), define an ordering for the
<br />
2nd index, namely that the bounds should be ordered in the same sense as the
<br />
coordinates, so that the 0-bound of cell i is on the side that faces cell i-1
<br />
and the 1-bound on the side facing cell i+1. [At present, there is no ordering
<br />
defined for 1D bounds.]
<br />
<br />(2) If 1D cells i and i+1 are contiguous, bound (i,1) should exactly equal
<br />
bound (i+1,0). The data-writer should ensure that this is so. [At present, the
<br />
standard does not state how contiguousness should be tested.]
<br />
<br />(3) When the horizontal coordinates are not lat and lon, we have to consider
<br />
two cases for the bounds in lat and lon. The first case is that in which there
<br />
are two horizontal dimensions and the cells are arranged in a 2D array (y,x)
<br />
such that for 0&lt;i&lt;x and all j, cell (j,i-1) and cell (j,i) are adjacent and for
<br />
0&lt;j&lt;y and all i, cell (j,i) and cell (j-1,i) are adjacent. (&quot;Adjacent&quot; means
<br />
there is no intervening cell, but does not imply &quot;contiguous&quot;.) In this case,
<br />
the lat and lon coordinates are supplied as 2D auxiliary coordinate variables
<br />
dimensioned (y,x) and the lat and lon bounds should be dimensioned
<br />
(y,x,2,2), where the first trailing index corresponds to the y dimension and
<br />
the second to the x. The trailing indexes have the same convention as for 1D
<br />
points, so that the 0-bound in either x or y is on the side which faces the
<br />
cell with the next smallest index in that dimension, the 1-bound on the side
<br />
facing the cell with the next largest index. In this case, if continuous 1D x
<br />
and y coordinates exist which are not pure indices, we recommend their 1D
<br />
bounds should be recorded, because the contiguousness of the cells can be
<br />
tested in 1D following (2) much more quickly than testing the contiguousness of
<br />
the 2D lat-lon cells; a check in 1D would be sufficient because a continuous
<br />
grid mapping in 2D will not affect contiguousness. If the coordinate system
<br />
x-y-upward is right-handed (like lon-lat-upward), the elements (j,i,0,0),
<br />
(j,i,0,1), (j,i,1,1), (j,i,1,0) in that order traverse the vertices of cell
<br />
(j,i) anticlockwise in the lon-lat plane as viewed from above. If the
<br />
coordinate system is left-handed, this sequence of elements traverse the
<br />
vertices clockwise. [The dimensioning of the 2D vertices is new.]
<br />
<br />(4) The other non-lat-lon case for the horizontal is that in which there are
<br />
one or more dimensions (n,...) to index the horizontal plane and the indices do
<br />
not indicate the adjacencies of the cells without special knowledge of the
<br />
grid. In this case, the lat and lon coordinates are dimensioned (...,n) and
<br />
their bounds should be dimensioned (...,n,p), with p&gt;2 being an index over
<br />
vertices.  The vertices must be traversed anticlockwise in the lon-lat plane as
<br />
viewed from above. The starting vertex is not specified by the standard.  [At
<br />
present, the standard does not state any ordering.]
