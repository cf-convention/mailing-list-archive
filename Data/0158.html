Dear Bob and Brian
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't have any objection to the (x,y,2,2) representation. I could be wrong, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there also seems to be a reasonable consensus that (x,y,2,2) is acceptable. Anyway
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think the main goal is to wrap up these final issues before summer arrives.
</em><br />
<br />I agree with the main goal! I hope we can decide in the next few days.
<br />
<br />Brian has argued that (y+1,x+1) is better for 2D contiguous rectilinear cells
<br />
because it indicates they are contiguous - the same argument as for 1D but
<br />
without the problem 1D has with the record dimension. I agree this is true but
<br />
as with 1D I am not convinced that it is a good idea to support two schemes,
<br />
since you would still need (y,x,2,2) or (y,x,4) for the non-contiguous case.
<br />
<br />I wondered if we could make it mandatory to supply 1D bounds for the 2D
<br />
rectilinear case. If you have 1D bounds, you can check them instead of the 2D
<br />
bounds. As we have discussed before, a continuous mapping such as a projection
<br />
will preserve contiguousness. However, this would be too large a requirement
<br />
because the 1D coordinate variables might not exist.
<br />
<br />Here's (yet) another idea. I am in effect *defining* 2D rectilinear to mean
<br />
that there exist continuous 1D x and y coordinates, even if they aren't
<br />
recorded in the file.  That excludes the situation where the cells had two
<br />
index dimensions but were not arranged as a 2D rectilinear array in any
<br />
continuous 2D coordinate plane. I would call that non-rectilinear.
<br />
<br />If we adopt (y,x,2,2) for the 2D rectilinear case,
<br />
<br />* It has the advantage of being distinguishable from the 2D non-rectilinear
<br />
case, which is dimensioned ([...,]x,2). The rectilinear case has two trailing
<br />
size-2 dimensions which aren't dimensions of the coordinate variable it
<br />
belongs to, and the non-rectilinear case has one trailing dimension of size&gt;2
<br />
which isn't a dimension of the coordinate variable.
<br />
<br />* If you know it is rectilinear, you *don't* have to check the entire bounds
<br />
variable for contiguousness. By the same argument as above, you have only to
<br />
check one row and one column. For instance, the slabs (0,*,0,*) and (*,0,*,0)
<br />
have shapes (x,2) and (y,2) respectively, like 1D bounds variables. It would
<br />
be sufficient to check these alone for contiguousness. True? If so, it is not
<br />
much more complicated than 1D. We can make the same requirement of exact
<br />
equality i.e. if the cells are contiguous in x, bound(j,i,q,1) must be
<br />
exactly equal to bound(j,i+1,q,0) for all j and q (j=0,...,y-1, q=0,1);
<br />
if they are contiguous in y, bound(j,i,1,p) must be exactly equal to
<br />
bound(j+1,i,0,p) for all i and p.
<br />
<br />If this is OK and sufficiently convenient, the modified proposals are as below.
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
<br />
<br /><br />(1) For a 1D coordinate variable with bounds (x,2), define an ordering for the
<br />
2nd index, namely that the bounds should be ordered in the same sense as the
<br />
coordinates, so that the 0-bound of cell i is on the side that faces cell i-1
<br />
and the 1-bound on the side facing cell i+1. [At present, there is no ordering
<br />
defined for 1D bounds.]
<br />
<br />(2) If 1D cells i and i+1 are contiguous, bound (i,1) should exactly equal
<br />
bound (i+1,0). The data-writer should ensure that this is so. [At present, the
<br />
standard does not state how contiguousness should be tested.]
<br />
<br />(3) In the 2D rectilinear case, the bounds should be dimensioned (y,x,2,2),
<br />
where the first trailing index corresponds to the y dimension and the second
<br />
to the x. The elements (j,i,0,0), (j,i,0,1), (j,i,1,1), (j,i,1,0) in that order
<br />
traverse the vertices of cell (j,i) anticlockwise in the lat-lon plane as
<br />
viewed from above. [This dimensioning of the 2D vertices is new.]
<br />
<br />(4) In the 2D rectilinear case, if cells (j,i) and (j,i+1) are contiguous in
<br />
x, bound(j,i,q,1) should exactly equal bound(j,i+1,q,0) for q=0 and q=1. If
<br />
cells (j,i) and (j+1,i) are contiguous in y, bound(j,i,1,p) should exactly
<br />
equal bound(j+1,i,0,p) for p=0 and p=1. Since a continuous grid mapping in 2D
<br />
will not affect contiguousness, it is sufficient to check any single value of j
<br />
and q for contiguousness in x, i and p for contiguousness in y.
<br />
<br />(5) In the non-rectilinear case, the bounds should be dimensioned
<br />
(...,n,p). The vertices must be traversed anticlockwise in the lat-lon plane
<br />
as viewed from above. The starting vertex is not specified by the standard.
<br />
[At present, the standard does not state any ordering.]
