<br />
As a CF newbie, I was hoping to be able to run a couple of questions by you CF 
<br />
knowbie folks. We are in the process of some diagnostic software work where we'd 
<br />
like to diverge from CF (or CF-like) practices as little as possible, but are 
<br />
not entirely sure how to accomplish that.
<br />
<br />The first question has to do with guidelines for names for variables such as 
<br />
accumulated degree days in their various forms (e.g., &quot;Growing Degree Days&quot;, 
<br />
&quot;Heating Degree Days&quot;, &quot;Cooling Degree Days&quot;, &quot;Freezing Degree Days&quot;, etc.). I 
<br />
don't think they're covered in the current CF standard name table, and for me, 
<br />
at least, they bring up some interesting questions (assuming such variables are 
<br />
of the type that the CF-conventions will eventually encompass).
<br />
<br />While a relatively simple concept, the various flavors of degree days pose some 
<br />
naming issues. There could be a naming building block of something like 
<br />
&quot;degree_days&quot; that would be consistent with the AMS Glossary definition 
<br />
(<a href="http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/browse?s=d&amp;p=11">http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/browse?s=d&amp;p=11</a>).
<br />
But there's also the issue of how one identifies the base (threshold) 
<br />
temperature (e.g., 0C for freezing days, or 65F for US heating and cooling 
<br />
days), and whether the accumulation of degree days occurs when the daily mean 
<br />
temperature is greater than the threshold (e.g., cooling DDs) or less than the 
<br />
threshold (e.g., heating DDs).
<br />
<br />Would names like...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;degree_days_above_65F
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;degree_days_below_0C
<br />
...make any sense in an evolving CF world, or would such names violate some 
<br />
basic CF style convention?  I assume it makes sense to include the threshold 
<br />
temperature info in the name itself (to allow one to distinguish between the 
<br />
different DD flavors) or would it be more appropriate to document that info in 
<br />
another attribute at the risk of non-unique variable names?
<br />
<br />The other part of my question has to do with the identification of the time 
<br />
period over which degree days may be accumulated (and here I admit to getting 
<br />
easily confused by CF and UDUNITS treatments of the time dimension). The problem 
<br />
has to do with a single variable that is accumulated over 12-month long seasons 
<br />
that are hemisphere dependent.  For example, national meteorological services 
<br />
can accumulate growing degree days and cooling degree days from 1 Jan to 31 Dec 
<br />
in the Northern Hemisphere, but from July 1 to June 30 in the Southern 
<br />
Hemisphere.  For heating and freezing degree days the hemisphere dependent 
<br />
12-month season definitions are offset 6 months from those mentioned in the 
<br />
previous sentence.
<br />
<br />So, what is one to do when post-processing climate model degree day output that 
<br />
will be compared to observational data?  Should one create two separate 
<br />
variables and files for each degree day type... one for the NH grid points and 
<br />
one for the SH ... to accommodate the differing season definitions (and perhaps 
<br />
extend the variable name to note the hemisphere of interest: e.g., 
<br />
degree_days_above_65F_NH)?  Or, should one be able to produce a single variable 
<br />
and file containing DD values for all global lat/lon grid points and adopt a 
<br />
time axis of, I don't know, say an integer year with a convention that the 
<br />
integer year number is that for the beginning of the 12 month season?
<br />
<br />Though I raise this question after considering degree day seasons, I realize 
<br />
that the same issue would apply to the growing season length variable that was 
<br />
requested as part of table A4 of the IPCC AR4 data sets 
<br />
(<a href="http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/ipcc/standard_output.html#Table_A4">http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/ipcc/standard_output.html#Table_A4</a>). Degree days are 
<br />
found on the STARDEX (<a href="http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/projects/stardex/">http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/projects/stardex/</a>) list of 
<br />
variables 
<br />
(<a href="http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/projects/stardex/deis/Diagnostic_tool.pdf">http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/cru/projects/stardex/deis/Diagnostic_tool.pdf</a>), as 
<br />
were the 10 variables contained in the IPCC's Frich et al.-based A4 table.
<br />
<br />-Keith
<br />
<br />PS - As background, such degree day quantities have the allure to some of our 
<br />
customers and researchers in that
<br />
(a) they link a purely meteorological measure [daily mean temperature: 
<br />
(Tmin+Tmax)/2 ] to something with more societal relevance (e.g., energy use, 
<br />
plant growth, ice conditions) via the use of a base temperature threshold, and
<br />
(b) accumulated over a 12 month season, they serve as a wonderful form of data 
<br />
reduction (a factor of 2*365) that, together with the use of a base temperature 
<br />
threshold, one can not achieve from considering annual mean temperature alone.
