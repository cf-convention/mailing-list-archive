Dear Steve et al.
<br />
<br />I agree with the goal that CF should be a broad standard and it would be a
<br />
great pity if the standard name table were an obstacle to that. I think that we
<br />
should in any case make it perfectly clear that files are compliant without
<br />
standard names. Like most CF features, they are optional. This should be stated
<br />
prominently e.g. at the top of the standard name table, on the CF home page, or
<br />
in the conventions document.
<br />
<br />I agree that user groups of CF should develop their own additions to the
<br />
standard name table. However, I share the concern of Roy's second paragraph,
<br />
that if there is a profileration of standard name tables, their entries will
<br />
overlap. As I see it, the main point of standard names is that they should
<br />
allow data from different communities and projects to be exchanged. If groups
<br />
have separate tables, this is not achieved, and standard names are useless as
<br />
such. I think it would be inappropriate to call them &quot;standard names&quot;; maybe we
<br />
ought to have a new attribute for them.
<br />
<br />Can we understand what problems we have with the current arrangement? One of
<br />
them is that it's slow. When questions are raised about standard names, it is
<br />
usually me who answers them; there's only one of me (I would be very happy if
<br />
more people joined in), and I agree with your assertion that I don't want to be
<br />
a naming authority for all physical parameters! A user group discussing among
<br />
themselves might much more quickly put together a list of what they need. This
<br />
has happened, for instance, with an ice sheet modelling initiative and with
<br />
PRISM (though the results of these two efforts haven't yet been proposed for
<br />
incorporation).
<br />
<br />The important step is what happens next. If a list of new standard names is
<br />
proposed, we might ask these kinds of question
<br />
<br />(1) What does this mean? Is it correctly and clearly described?
<br />
<br />(2) Is this the same thing as such-and-such which we already have in the table?
<br />
<br />(3) Can we make this consistent with how we have named other such quantities?
<br />
<br />The third kind of question could certainly be avoided if the standard name
<br />
table were split up. I believe that consistency is useful in order to
<br />
understand the names and to make it easier to add new ones, but for better or
<br />
worse their style largely reflects decisions I have made, and I might well be
<br />
wrong about them.
<br />
<br />The other two kinds of question cannot be avoided if exchange of data among
<br />
different groups is going to work. Answering these questions is *difficult*. It
<br />
requires a lot of intellectual effort. Maybe that's the bottleneck. Devolving
<br />
standard name tables does not answer these questions - it just sidesteps them.
<br />
So it would certainly save effort, but the result would be less useful.
<br />
<br />If we have a range of tables, I would therefore advocate:
<br />
<br />* There should still be a central standard name table, into which others should
<br />
be mapped or incorporated, as Roy has offered.
<br />
<br />* The developers of tables should be very strongly urged carefully to check
<br />
whether quantities they require already have standard names, and only include
<br />
ones that don't in their tables.
<br />
<br />* They should provide descriptions of the quantities in their tables.
<br />
<br />* The tables should be linked from the CF website. That way we can see what is
<br />
being worked out, and we'll be in a much better position to consider how we can
<br />
map/incorporate them into the central table.
<br />
<br />These actions might help to avoid fragmentation and to engage groups in trying
<br />
to use a common vocabulary at an early stage, in the way Roy suggests.  The OTS
<br />
list is a good example, for instance. Most of these quantities do already have
<br />
standard names. It's a small list and we could certainly add names for the
<br />
other ones. OTS could propose some, following the guidelines. That seems a much
<br />
better route to me than introducing a new table. It would be very valuable if
<br />
timeseries from ocean buoys could be easily compared with ocean models; if they
<br />
don't use the same standard names, this will be inhibited.
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
