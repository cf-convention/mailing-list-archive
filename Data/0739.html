<br />
Dear all
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; all variables regarding the platform are prefaced with 'platform_'
</em><br />
<br />I agree that &quot;platform&quot; is a useful generic name for something moving from
<br />
which observations are made.
<br />
<br />We are discussing standard names for quantities which are properties of the
<br />
platform, such as its velocity. This is different from existing standard
<br />
names, which describe observable properties of the world and say nothing about
<br />
the observer or the method of observation. The platform_ standard names are
<br />
providing information which is useful for interpreting or correcting the
<br />
measurements, I presume. In a sense it is metadata rather than data, since
<br />
once the appropriate corrections have been made and the data from different
<br />
sources assembled into some dataset that could be used as a climatology, for
<br />
example, there is no further need for the information about the platform.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; latitude, longitude and altitude are not appropriately prefaced.
</em><br />
<br />I don't think we need platform_ versions of these since they are coordinates.
<br />
Practically, if we did introduce platform_latitude, I don't think people would
<br />
use it consistently instead of latitude.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Jonathans earlier confusion where he didn't even realize [I think] that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; true_air_speed was that of the aircraft and not the wind.
</em><br />
<br />Since I wasn't certain, I was suggesting that &quot;ground speed&quot; and &quot;air speed&quot;,
<br />
although commonly used terms, do not have completely obvious meanings. Hence I
<br />
propose standard names of:
<br />
<br />platform_speed_wrt_ground (&quot;ground speed&quot;) (m s-1)
<br />
platform_speed_wrt_air (&quot;air speed&quot;) (m s-1)
<br />
platform_speed_wrt_sea_water (&quot;water speed&quot;) (m s-1)
<br />
<br />Is it usual to speak of ship ground speed i.e. relative to the solid Earth,
<br />
even though no ground is evident?
<br />
<br />I *don't* think we should have separate standard names for indicated and true
<br />
air speed if these are the same quantity with and without some correction.
<br />
While the speed of the platform is an observable quantity which some other
<br />
observer could measure, corrections of various kinds relate to instruments and
<br />
methods of measurement, and we could get into huge complexity if we try to
<br />
include that kind of metadata in standard names, I fear.  Another attribute
<br />
should be used to characterise corrections, such as long_name or comment.
<br />
<br />Similarly, we need
<br />
<br />platform_pitch_angle (degree)
<br />
platform_roll_angle (degree)
<br />
<br />What about yaw (the third axis)?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; There is also potential for platform_pitch_rate...
</em><br />
<br />platform_pitch_rate (degree s-1)
<br />
platform_roll_rate (degree s-1)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is there anything wrong with using platform_heading ... and platform_course?
</em><br />
<br />The problem with &quot;heading&quot; is that it means direction of travel as well as
<br />
the direction you're pointing in. That's what I understood it to mean when
<br />
Michael proposed it, and why I asked if it was the same thing as course.
<br />
Looking on Google, I find that half the definitions are direction of travel.
<br />
Hence &quot;heading&quot; is too confusing, I'd say. How about
<br />
<br />platform_orientation (degree) for the direction the platform is pointing in
<br />
platform_course (degree) for the direction it's travelling in?
<br />
<br />Again, I don't think we should have names for &quot;true&quot; heading, quantities with
<br />
and without correction for magnetic declination, etc.
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
