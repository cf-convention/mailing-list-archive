Hi Folks
<br />
<br />Sorry about the long silence. Those who know me, will know I have strong 
<br />
opinions about a number of the things being discussed recently, so you'll 
<br />
also know that the fact I haven't been replying is due to other pressures. 
<br />
Anyway, I'm out from under for a while ...
<br />
<br />I'll comment on a number of other threads shortly, but firstly I wanted to 
<br />
expose some ideas some of us have about the future of CF.
<br />
<br />Firstly, I think we'll all agree that CF is evolving.
<br />
Secondly, I suspect most of us are having trouble holding the various threads 
<br />
of activity in our heads, and the current status of those threads.
<br />
Thirdly, the CF authors, who are our benevolent dictators (using a phrase 
<br />
beloved of the programme language community), have all at one time or another 
<br />
expressed that they can't cope (quickly enough) either ...
<br />
Fourthly, anyone attempting to write code based on CF is faced with a standard 
<br />
that is getting harder and harder to interpret
<br />
Fifthly (stop numbering everything Bryan), the standard name vocabulary is 
<br />
becoming unwieldy in and of itself to manage
<br />
Sixthly (I failed to stop :-), CF is becoming so important it is having to 
<br />
interoperate with other communities (e.g. GIS, of which more in a later 
<br />
email) ...
<br />
<br />You get the picture. I could have written more.
<br />
<br />So what can we do about it?
<br />
<br />One of the things I think we need is a methodology which is more sophisticated 
<br />
than a mailing list to keep track of threads and discussions. Things need to 
<br />
be marked as live, or forgotten, or under action, or going into a future 
<br />
VERSION of CF.  OK, one of my cards on the table: we need version control! We 
<br />
also need a mechanism of making a decision about what's happening, and we 
<br />
need more status information.
<br />
<br />&lt;We&gt; needs to be defined. In my mind &lt;we&gt; is the entire CF community. Well, we 
<br />
all know how efficient a committee is at building things, so a mailing list 
<br />
in and of itself doesn't make decisions... arguably CF is successful because 
<br />
we have a decision making process (the CF authors have final say). But for 
<br />
how long can they keep that up? If we want to change things, how could we 
<br />
change them? What happens when the CF authors interests start to diverge from 
<br />
the community of CF users?
<br />
<br />I would argue we need a community process, perhaps including an elected 
<br />
committee, perhaps including the right of veto from the CF authors (or some 
<br />
trusted group of folk). There are lots of options. This email isn't so much 
<br />
about what we do, as about suggesting a strategy to coming up with a process.
<br />
<br />(And, we need a standards track. We need CF to become more than a community 
<br />
standard, we would like WMO to take it on board etc ... if that happened, 
<br />
then we really do have an incentive for writing code which understands and 
<br />
exploits CF.)
<br />
<br />Anyway, back to the strategy. So what should that strategy be? Some of you 
<br />
will know of the Global-Organisation for Earth System Science Portals 
<br />
(GO-ESSP, see <a href="http://go-essp.gfdl.noaa.gov/">http://go-essp.gfdl.noaa.gov/</a>). We have a meeting in June, in 
<br />
the UK, and on the agenda we will have a discussion of the future of CF. All 
<br />
the CF authors except Brian can and will make it. (Meeting details at: 
<br />
<a href="http://go-essp.gfdl.noaa.gov/news_meetings.html">http://go-essp.gfdl.noaa.gov/news_meetings.html</a>).
<br />
<br />On the table will be some real support for CF activities rather than 
<br />
best-effort activities. I expect (but wont be able to confirm til June) to 
<br />
have 50% of an FTE on CF support at the BADC from April 2006. It would be 
<br />
nice if we could find some other players who can commit some real effort to 
<br />
making this work. Having done that we obviously need a mechanism to make sure 
<br />
those of us managing and funding the effort are doing what the community 
<br />
wants, rather than what we want alone (if we did the latter, we'd be wasting 
<br />
the effort).
<br />
<br />Obviously not everyone who cares can come to that meeting, and many of those 
<br />
who care wont want to come because CF is only a small part of the agenda. So 
<br />
it will be important for us to canvas opinion via this email list before that 
<br />
meeting.
<br />
<br />So, this long email is by way of foreshadowing (and perhaps engendering) what 
<br />
I hope will be some vociferous discussion of how we take CF forward. I think 
<br />
we all agree that it is important, and I hope we can find some consensus on a 
<br />
mechanism for community maintenance of CF that maintains the existing rigor 
<br />
(spelt like an American to show how International I can be :-), but is easier 
<br />
for the community to use and evolve. (For evolve we must :-)
<br />
<br />Discuss :-)
<br />
