<br />
Hi Jonathan and Roland,
<br />
<br />What strikes me about this exchange is that even though the current name
<br />
table apparently contains names for quantities that Roland needed to
<br />
identify, the table is not user friendly enough that he was able to
<br />
recognize those names.  I think this shortcoming in our current table is at
<br />
least partly due to trying to express too much of the quantity definition
<br />
in the standard name itself.  In support of this claim I note that only
<br />
about 1/3 the standard names even have associated definitions, the rest
<br />
depend on the name being self describing via the definitions of its
<br />
component parts.  This makes the table hard to use because you have to grub
<br />
through it looking for the definitions of those parts.  I think the table
<br />
would be easier to use if the individual definitions were self contained.
<br />
<br />This leads me to make the following suggestions:
<br />
<br />1) I think it's more important that the standard names follow accepted
<br />
earth sciences conventions than it is for them to be self describing.  Thus
<br />
it's better to use a term like &quot;precipitation rate&quot; which then requires its
<br />
units and possibly other description to define it (does precip refer to
<br />
particular condensed phases of water?).  I personally find names
<br />
like mass_flux_density to be confusing since they are describing what I
<br />
know simply as a mass_flux.  Since the canonical units are part of the
<br />
definition of the quantity, northward_salt_mass_flux_in_ocean can have
<br />
units of kg/m2 and upward_water_vapour_mass_flux_in_air can have units of
<br />
kg/m2/s without risk of confusion due to mass_flux being used in two
<br />
distinct senses.  This implies that the generic standard_name mass_flux
<br />
should be removed from the table since its common usage is ambiguous with
<br />
regards to its units.
<br />
<br />2) In the interest of providing a user friendly table, and recognizing that
<br />
there are many terms with conflicting conventional usage, I propose that we
<br />
make use of the alias mechanism to provide multiple standard names whenever
<br />
a case can be made that the standard_name being proposed has widespread
<br />
use.  I would consider the appearance of a name in a GRIB table to be
<br />
sufficient evidence of widespread use.
<br />
<br />3) Whenever an abbreviation is used in a standard name the corresponding
<br />
definition should spell it out.
<br />
<br />While we're on the topic of standard names I'd like to respond to some
<br />
suggestions that Jonathan made on 12 Dec 2001:
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think LW and SW would be OK as replacements for longwave and shortwave.
</em><br />
<br />In general I think that staying away from abbreviations like this will make
<br />
the standard names more readable (at least to speakers of English).
<br />
<br />If we use longwave as an abbreviation for &quot;longwave radiation&quot;, and flux as
<br />
an abbreviation for &quot;flux density&quot;, then longwave_radiation_flux_density
<br />
becomes longwave_flux.  Also, I vote for putting the &quot;net&quot; into the
<br />
standard_name of flux quantities when that's what's meant.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; It would be nice to have an abbrev for the clumsy phrase &quot;rate_of_change_of&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't think there is a very standard abbrev for this, but perhaps &quot;ROCO&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would be understandable?
</em><br />
<br />Our convention is to use the term &quot;tendency&quot;.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Could you replace the three quantities of the form &quot;northward_*_in_ocean&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with &quot;northward_ocean_*&quot;? If you do that, we can make a clear distinction
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; between what are currently the two occurrences of &quot;medium&quot; in the template.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would propose
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [surface] [component] [large_scale_medium] base_standard_name [at surface]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; [in material] [due to process] [where type] [assuming condition]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; where large_scale_medium is e.g. ocean or atmosphere, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; material is e.g. air, sea_water, sea_ice.
</em><br />
<br />This seems OK to me as a guideline for name construction.  But again, I
<br />
think we need to give more weight to common usage and not be too bound by a
<br />
rigid formula for name construction.
<br />
<br />Best regards,
<br />
Brian
