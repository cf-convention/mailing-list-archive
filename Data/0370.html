Dear Robb
<br />
<br />Thanks for your posting about this and sorry for the delay in response. I
<br />
presume it's the quantities in your long names that you would like standard
<br />
names for. Your list raises a number of questions (below).
<br />
<br />I'm glad you're working on this; it would be good to define equivalences
<br />
between CF and standards such as METAR.  When we have settled such questions as
<br />
below, we should probably set up a table describing the mapping as we have for
<br />
GRIB and AMIP (they're linked from the standard name table HTML document).
<br />
<br />Thanks for your help. Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
<br />
<br /><br />observation time: Can we use just &quot;time&quot; for this? We use the standard name of
<br />
time for forecast validity/analysis time, so that would be consistent. Since
<br />
some of the quantities in the report apply to an interval of time, such as peak
<br />
wind speed and accumulated precipitation, the time coordinate variable should
<br />
have boundary coordinates to record the start and end times of the interval.
<br />
<br />time nominal: What is this used for? Do METARs record two different times?
<br />
<br />Peak wind speed: The peak wind speed within a time interval does not need a
<br />
special standard name, as it can be given a standard name of wind_speed, with a
<br />
cell_methods attribute of the variable indicating that it is a maximum in time.
<br />
<br />Wind gust: What is the difference between this and the peak wind speed?
<br />
<br />Peak wind direction: I presume this is the direction of the wind which has the
<br />
maximum speed within the time interval. Is that right? If so, that is a new
<br />
kind of idea for CF, because it defines a quantity in terms of the within-cell
<br />
variation of another quantity. I am not sure whether we should simply define a
<br />
standard name for this, or whether there's something more general we should
<br />
introduce.
<br />
<br />Peak wind time: This is a related question. Whatever its standard name, I
<br />
suggest this should be encoded in the same way as other times i.e. time-units
<br />
since reference-time, not as a character string.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
Wind from direction minimum/maximum: I am not sure what these directions mean.
<br />
<br />Visibility in air direction: I presume this is the direction in which the
<br />
horizontal visibility was measured. Is that right? If so, we probably don't
<br />
need a specific standard name for it. We could introduce a standard name of
<br />
plain &quot;direction&quot;, which will be a coordinate for the variable of visibility,
<br />
like this:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;dimensions:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;visibility_direction=1;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;variables:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;float visibility_direction(visibility_direction);
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;visibility_direction:standard_name=&quot;direction&quot;;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;float visibility(visibility_direction);
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;visibility:standard_name=&quot;visibility_in_air&quot;;
<br />
<br />It could alternatively be put in a scalar coordinate variable, to avoid
<br />
defining a dimension of size one.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;variables:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;float visibility_direction;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;visibility_direction:standard_name=&quot;direction&quot;;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;float visibility;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;visibility:standard_name=&quot;visibility_in_air&quot;;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;visibility:coordinates=&quot;visibility_direction&quot;;
<br />
<br />Why would you use a character string for the direction, rather than a floating-
<br />
point number?
<br />
<br />Visibility in air: I agree we need vertical_visibility_in_air, so probably we
<br />
should introduce a new standard name of horizontal_visibility_in_air and make
<br />
the existing standard name of visibility_in_air an alias for it. But I note
<br />
that for horizontal visibility you introduce &quot;surface&quot;. Is visibility sometimes
<br />
measured or reported at levels above the surface? If so we ought to put
<br />
&quot;surface&quot; in both horizontal and vertical standard names.
<br />
<br />low/medium/high cloud: Are these three defined in terms of cloud type or
<br />
altitude range, or are they simply a set of (up to) three layers that can be
<br />
reported, regardless of their height? In the former case, we need definitions
<br />
for low/medium/high. In the latter case, the definition is the cloud base
<br />
altitude which you are also supplying. In that case I don't think we need new
<br />
standard names, because the information can be structured like this:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;dimensions:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cloud_altitude=3;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;variables:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cloud_altitude(cloud_altitude); // coordinate variable
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cloud_altitude:standard_name=&quot;cloud_base_altitude&quot;;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fraction(cloud_altitude); // data variable
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fraction:standard_name=&quot;cloud_area_fraction&quot;;
<br />
<br />weather: If we define a standard_name of weather_phenomenon, we should define
<br />
also the values it can have, by either pointing to or copying the table. Do you
<br />
have a URL for &quot;WMO #306, code table 4658&quot;? I guess it is similar to the
<br />
abbreviations in <a href="http://www.asy.faa.gov/safety_products/metar-taf99.html">http://www.asy.faa.gov/safety_products/metar-taf99.html</a>.
<br />
<br />amounts of precipitation: New standard names aren't needed for these, as you
<br />
can use precipitation_amount and snowfall_amount. The default interpretation
<br />
for these quantities is an accumulation within the time interval, because they
<br />
are extensive in time (the values depend on the length of the time interval).
<br />
The time interval is recorded in the boundary variable of the time coordinate
<br />
variable. If the quantities are in units of distance, such as inches, the
<br />
standard_names should be lwe_thickness_of_precipitation_amount and
<br />
lwe_thickness_of_snowfall_amount (lwe=liquid water equivalent). For some reason
<br />
the former isn't already in the table and obviously should be added.
