Dear All
<br />
<br />I'd like to make the following proposals concerning bounds.
<br />
<br />(1) For a 1D coordinate variable, if no bounds are supplied, assume the cells
<br />
are contiguous. (Of course, for most calculations you will have to make a
<br />
further assumption about what the bounds actually are. This is up to the
<br />
application, so it is obviously better that the bounds should be supplied.)
<br />
<br />(2) For a 1D coordinate variable, bounds should be supplied in a variable of
<br />
dimension (n,2). Let us extend the standard by defining an ordering for the
<br />
second index, namely that the bounds should be ordered in the same sense as the
<br />
coordinates. This means that if coordinate i is less/greater than coordinate
<br />
i+1, bound 0 should be less/greater than bound 1. Hence, for i&gt;0, bound (i,0)
<br />
lies between coordinates i-1 and i, and for i&lt;n-1, bound (i,1) lies between
<br />
coordinates i and i+1. More descriptively, the 0-bound of cell i is on the side
<br />
that faces cell i-1 and the 1-bound on the side facing cell i+1.
<br />
<br />E.g. coordinates    1,        2,        3;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bounds         0.5, 1.5, 1.5, 2.5, 2.5, 3.5;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;coordinates    3,        2,        1;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bounds         3.5, 2.5, 2.5, 1.5, 1.5, 0.5;
<br />
<br />(3) It follows that cells i and i+1 are contiguous if bound (i,1) equals bound
<br />
(i+1,0). Some tolerance is needed for equality. This cannot be precisely
<br />
defined, but I suggest that it is adequate to say that the absolute difference
<br />
between the bounds concerned must be much smaller (several orders of magnitude)
<br />
than the absolute difference between the gridpoints of the cells. For instance,
<br />
the difference between 2.49999 and 2.50001 is much smaller than the difference
<br />
between 2 and 3. This, I suggest, is what we mean by contiguousness in
<br />
practice. Let us draw the two cells independently and &quot;stand back&quot; far enough
<br />
from the picture that we can see both the gridpoints. If, from this viewpoint,
<br />
the boundaries appear to be coincident - that is, they are so close we can't
<br />
tell them apart - we say the cells are contiguous.
<br />
<br />(4) When a 2D array of cells cover a 2D surface that has a continuous mapping
<br />
(for instance a plane projection or a rotation) onto latitude and longitude,
<br />
the latitude and longitude coordinates must be supplied (according to CF) in 2D
<br />
auxiliary coordinate variables (n,m). If bounds are supplied, they should be
<br />
dimensioned (n,m,2,2), where the 3rd index corresponds to n and the 4th to m.
<br />
(This is a change from the current CF standard.) The fact of the bounds being
<br />
&quot;2D&quot; with both the bounds dimensions having size 2 indicates that the spatial
<br />
dimensions can be factorised.
<br />
<br />(5) CF recommends that 1D variables y(n) and x(m) are supplied in this
<br />
situation. Let us say that (a) if a 1D variable is not supplied, the cells
<br />
should be assumed contiguous in that dimension; (b) if a 1D variable is
<br />
supplied, but without bounds, then (1) applies i.e. they are again assumed
<br />
contiguous; (c) if bounds are supplied, they are ordered according to (2) so
<br />
contiguousness can be tested by (3). If they are contiguous in 1D, they must be
<br />
contiguous when transformed to lat and lon, and it's easier to test in 1D.
<br />
<br />IMPORTANT: All these assumptions are made *without* checking the points
<br />
supplied by (4), if any. It would therefore be an ERROR to fail to supply 1D
<br />
bounds for cells which were *not* contiguous in dimensions which participate in
<br />
a 2D mapping to lat and lot. If we have this condition, we do not need to be
<br />
able to check for contiguousness using (4).
<br />
<br />(6) As a consequence of the ordering of the 1D bounds, the 2D vertices of (4)
<br />
have a particular ordering in x,y space. It doesn't trace round clockwise or
<br />
anticlockwise, but zigzags, connecting the vertices in an N or a Z or their
<br />
mirror images.
<br />
<br />(7) Paragraphs (4) and (5) could also apply for 2D mappings in other
<br />
coordinates than lat and lon, or for mappings involving more than two
<br />
dimensions. For instance, if we had a 3D mapping of two horizontal dimensions
<br />
and a vertical dimension (e.g.  model levels which depend on position on a map
<br />
projection) to (height,lat,lon) we would have lat boundary variables
<br />
dimensioned (p,n,m,2,2,2).
<br />
<br />(8) When cells cover a lat-lon surface but are not arranged in a 2D array on
<br />
any surface that can be mapped continuously into latitude and longitude, it is
<br />
not possible to supply 1D coordinate variables for the dimensions separately.
<br />
In this case the cells might have a single dimension to order them, or they
<br />
could have more. In the example supplied by Reiner, the cells have three
<br />
indices, even though they are covering a 2D lat-lon surface. In this case, the
<br />
vertices in latitude and longitude are supplied by the boundary variables of
<br />
the auxiliary coordinates, which are dimensioned (m,v) or (n,m,v) or (p,n,m,v)
<br />
or in general (...,v), according to how many dimensions there are.  The
<br />
trailing dimension is an index over the vertices. The fact that there is only a
<br />
single bounds dimension, which has size v&gt;2, indicates that the cells do not
<br />
cover a 2D surface that can be continuously mapped to lat and lon. This
<br />
situation is the one already included in CF. We require that the vertices must
<br />
be traversed clockwise or anticlockwise. It could be stipulated which way it
<br />
should be by defining it to be anticlockwise in the lat-lon plane as viewed
<br />
from above. I think that would be clear.
<br />
<br />(9) Paragraph (8) could apply to cells in planes other than lat-lon. In that
<br />
case it would be harder to define what clockwise and anticlockwise mean.
<br />
<br />(10) Testing the bounds defined by (8) is a complicated operation, as Steve
<br />
pointed out. This seems unavoidable - there is no short cut. However, you might
<br />
want to save the results. I suggested in an earlier posting a scheme we might
<br />
adopt for this (on Mon Mar 17 at 17:49:50).
<br />
<br />How does the above strike you?
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
