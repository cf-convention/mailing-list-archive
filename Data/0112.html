Dear All
<br />
<br />Here are some more points about boundary coordinates.
<br />
<br />I accept the argument that it is nice to be able to tell from (n+1) boundaries
<br />
that the cells are contiguous. This is of course an advantage, and another
<br />
advantage is that this method has been commonly used. However, COARDS didn't
<br />
standardise any method for boundaries so whatever we do will present problems
<br />
for some existing data.
<br />
<br />Generic applications: As I've said, the reason I'm unhappy about supporting
<br />
both (n+1) and (n,2) boundaries is that it makes the standard more
<br />
complicated. I am worried in particular that writers of generic applications or
<br />
data-users writing their own ad-hoc analysis code may not implement (n,2) if
<br />
(n+1) is used more commonly.  That would mean we would have to wait longer for
<br />
full CF support, and that some programs would have problems with some
<br />
data. Bounds are a pretty basic requirement so this would be a nuisance.
<br />
<br />Writing data: Even if we require (n+1) to be used for contiguous cells, writers
<br />
of data might use (n,2) when it is more convenient. For example, if you are
<br />
making a 3D variable (time,lat,lon) by concatenating separate (lat,lon)
<br />
variables, each with its own 2-element time bounds, it is convenient to produce
<br />
a (n,2) time boundary variable. To require (n+1) to be used means the
<br />
data-writer has to do a contiguousness check and write data in two different
<br />
formats according to the results. If we want to encourage people to write
<br />
CF-compliant data, we don't want to make it more difficult for them to do
<br />
so. On the other hand, if contiguous cells may be written in (2,n) format,
<br />
applications reading data cannot make any assumptions and have to be able to
<br />
check for themselves, just as if we did not support (n+1), so nothing has been
<br />
gained by complicating the standard.
<br />
<br />Record dimension: This problem has already been raised. Doesn't it mean that
<br />
(n+1) can't be used for the unlimited dimension? Wouldn't that imply, again,
<br />
that applications need to be able to check (n,2) for contiguousness?
<br />
<br />Wrap-round axis: A longitude axis spanning the whole world has only (n)
<br />
boundaries. Even if written in (n+1) form it must contain extreme boundaries
<br />
which are equal under modulo 360; it is not possible to avoid having to check
<br />
for contiguousness in order to determine whether it is a wrap-round axis.
<br />
<br />1D case: In an earlier posting I said that you couldn't depend on the order of
<br />
the boundaries in (n,2). Obviously we could adopt one. For instance, we could
<br />
say that the sequence bound(i,0), point(i), bound(i,1), bound(i+1,0), ...  must
<br />
be monotonic. In that case the extrema are bound(0,0) and bound(n-1,1), and
<br />
contiguousness is tested by comparing bound(i,1) with bound(i+1,0) e.g. if
<br />
(abs(bound(i+1,0)-bound(i,1)).lt.1e-5*abs(point(i+1)-point(i))) i.e. the
<br />
boundaries between adjacent cells are much closer together - even if not
<br />
exactly coincident because of numerical imprecision - than the grid
<br />
points. This convention is easy to implement and check for correctness because
<br />
it depends on numerical comparison.
<br />
<br />2D case: I think we ought to distinguish between the polygon case and the
<br />
quadrilateral case. The bounds for the former cannot be decomposed into two
<br />
separate dimensions. Any number of vertices may be needed. The cells themselves
<br />
may not be in a 2D array. Contiguousness is complicated to test. In the
<br />
quadrilateral case, however, the bounds arrays can be dimensioned
<br />
bounds(n,m,2,2), as Steve says. If we adopt the above 1D convention for
<br />
ordering, we then know which 2D bounds to compare for contiguousness of any
<br />
pair of adjacent cells. This has the same purpose as saying the four points
<br />
must be ordered clockwise or anticlockwise.  (The reason I am worried about
<br />
(anti)clockwise ordering is that I fear people might sometimes get confused
<br />
about whether they were considering index space or real space to decide the
<br />
sign convention.) Two notes on this:
<br />
<br />* bounds(n,m,2,2) can be equivalenced/reformed to bounds(n,m,4) if users prefer
<br />
to view them that way. The points would be arranged as a Z rather than as going
<br />
round the perimeter.
<br />
<br />* In the quadrilateral case, the 2D bounds are on auxiliary coordinate
<br />
variables. If the 1D coordinate variables have bounds as well, these can be
<br />
checked for contiguousness, which is easier.
<br />
<br />I am sorry this is rather long. I hope it makes sense.
<br />
<br />Jonathan
