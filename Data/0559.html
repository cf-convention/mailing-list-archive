Dear All
<br />
<br />I like the idea of making use of the definitions provided by EPSG for mappings
<br />
and ellipsoids. Their document defining the formulae looks useful too.
<br />
<br />I can see the attraction of adopting a shorthand for mapping and ellipsoid
<br />
which is used by other software, but I'm not convinced that we should do that
<br />
for CF because
<br />
<br />* only a subset of the CF community are users of GIS software, WMS servers
<br />
and MS Access. I'm not familiar with any of these, for instance, and I expect
<br />
I am typical of scientists working with GCMs. It would make CF less easily
<br />
usable, for those who are not, to tie ourselves to particular software.
<br />
<br />* codes are not self-describing. We haven't used codes anywhere else in CF
<br />
because it means you can't understand the file without the code table, so we
<br />
prefer to use names. Of course, names may not provide *all* the necessary
<br />
information; you may still need reference documents such as the CF appendices
<br />
and the descriptions of standard names, but names do enable a human to get a
<br />
rough understanding of the contents of the file without such help.
<br />
<br />So far CF is self-contained. When we have used information from elsewhere,
<br />
such as the projections, or the names for regions (from the NASA GCMD), we
<br />
have explicitly incorporated them in CF. The reason for that is that the other
<br />
sources haven't provided the detail or the self-consistency we needed. EPSG
<br />
is a large database. It might be difficult to choose a subset of it, and as
<br />
Rich says this could be inconvenient for the unfortunate user whose options
<br />
weren't included. But adopting it wholesale would means we would make CF
<br />
depend on EPSG continuing to maintain it, and we might expose CF to EPSG
<br />
making backward-incompatible changes.
<br />
<br />How much work would it to be to extract a snapshot of EPSG listing the names
<br />
of all the ellipsoids, projections and their parameters? We could copy such a
<br />
snapshot into a CF appendix, and if the process was fairly automated we could
<br />
repeat it from time to time. If it works well, perhaps we could negotiate with
<br />
EPSG for them to supply exactly what we need. In making the snapshot, I would
<br />
favour continuing CF conventions in translating all names to lower case and
<br />
replacing spaces with underscores, for consistency of style. The snapshot
<br />
could give equivalences to EPSG codes (as we do with GRID and PCMDI codes for
<br />
standard names), and if we provide a machineable form of it, software of the
<br />
kind Rich mentioned could use it to translate. We would also have to resolve
<br />
any inconsistency with the projections we have already defined.
<br />
<br />Rich and EPSG have clarified that projection and ellipsoid are different.
<br />
Hence we should add allow attributes defining the ellipsoid to be added to
<br />
any grid_mapping that needs them (name, semi-major axis, flattening).
<br />
<br />With that clarification, it's not obvious to me why UTM needs to be a new
<br />
mapping. All we need is to say how the UTM zone number translates to the TM
<br />
parameters, don't we?
<br />
<br />I'm going to be silent for a couple of weeks because of a conference.
<br />
<br />Jonathan
