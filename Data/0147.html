Dear All
<br />
<br />I believe the issue of bounds is the only thing which stands in the way of a
<br />
non-beta release of CF. There hasn't been any further activity on that thread
<br />
this month, so I'd like to restart it by summarising the position. I think
<br />
there are three cases to distinguish in the current CF draft:
<br />
<br />1D: A coordinate variable x(x) has bounds (x,2) i.e. each cell has an upper and
<br />
a lower boundary. This allows cells to be non-contiguous or overlapping, but it
<br />
means a check is needed to determine whether they are contiguous.
<br />
<br />2D rectilinear: In the case when lat and lon are not 1D axes but there are two
<br />
1D projection/transformation axes x and y in the horizontal plane, the
<br />
auxiliary coordinates lat(y,x) and lon(y,x) have bounds (y,x,4). The order of
<br />
the vertices is not specified. The axes x and y can themselves have 1D bounds.
<br />
The 2D cells are contiguous in lat and lon if they are contiguous in x and y,
<br />
so contiguousness can be checked in 1D if the bounds are supplied.
<br />
<br />2D non-rectilinear: In the case when the horizontal cells are not arranged in a
<br />
2D array, they have one or more index dimensions n,..., with auxiliary
<br />
coordinate variables lat(...,n) and lon(...,n) having bounds (...,n,p), where p
<br />
is the number of vertices of the cells e.g. they could be hexagonal. Checking
<br />
for contiguous cells in this case is complicated.
<br />
<br />In the 1D case, an alternative representation for contiguous cells would have
<br />
bounds (x+1), the bounds of cell i having indices i and i+1. This scheme is not
<br />
currently included in CF but may seem more obvious. It has the attraction that
<br />
contiguousness is guaranteed by construction and therefore does not have to be
<br />
tested. This avoids the difficulty of deciding how to check for contiguousness
<br />
reliably, given numerical imprecision.
<br />
<br />However, it has the drawbacks (a) it can't be used for the unlimited dimension,
<br />
(b) it doesn't avoid an explicit contiguousness check for wrap-round axes e.g.
<br />
longitude, in which the first and last boundaries may be coincident, (c) it may
<br />
be unreliable to assume that all contiguous cases use (x+1), since (x,2) must
<br />
also be supported; hence a contiguousness check may still be needed for (x,2).
<br />
<br />My own opinion is that we should stick with supporting just (x,2) for 1D and
<br />
not allow (x+1) as an alternative. I don't think that the advantage of not
<br />
having to test for contiguousness in certain cases justifies the extra
<br />
complexity of supporting two schemes in the standard.
<br />
<br />I'd like to make the following proposals concerning bounds (a summary of what I
<br />
proposed in my last posting):
<br />
<br />(1) In the 1D case, if no bounds are supplied, assume contiguous cells.
<br />
<br />(2) For a 1D coordinate variable with bounds (x,2), define an ordering for the
<br />
2nd index, namely that the bounds should be ordered in the same sense as the
<br />
coordinates, so that the 0-bound of cell i is on the side that faces cell i-1
<br />
and the 1-bound on the side facing cell i+1.
<br />
<br />(3) It follows that cells i and i+1 are contiguous if bound (i,1) equals bound
<br />
(i+1,0), with a tolerance that the absolute difference between the bounds must
<br />
be several orders of magnitude smaller than the absolute difference between the
<br />
gridpoints of the cells.
<br />
<br />(4) In the 2D rectilinear case, the bounds should be dimensioned (y,x,2,2),
<br />
where the 3rd index corresponds to y and the 4th to x.  (This is a change from
<br />
the current CF standard.) This case is indicated by their being two trailing
<br />
dimensions of size 2. Contiguousness should be checked on the bounds of the 1D
<br />
coordinate variables rather than the 2D auxiliary coordinate variables.  As a
<br />
consequence of the ordering of the 1D bounds, the 2D vertices are ordered in a
<br />
&quot;zigzag&quot; - an N or a Z or their mirror images.
<br />
<br />(5) In the non-rectilinear case, the bounds should be dimensioned (...,n,p) (no
<br />
change to CF). The fact that there is only a single bounds dimension, which has
<br />
size p&gt;2, indicates this case. The vertices must be traversed anticlockwise in
<br />
the lat-lon plane as viewed from above. Testing for contiguousness is a
<br />
complicated operation, so you might want to save the results. I suggested in an
<br />
earlier posting a scheme we might adopt for this (on Mon Mar 17 at 17:49:50).
<br />
<br />Best wishes
<br />
<br />Jonathan
