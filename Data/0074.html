Hi Jonathan,
<br />
<br />Sorry, but I'm not convinced.  
<br />
<br />Readability of a CDL file should be secondary to its accuracy and
<br />
maintainability.  And CDL is not really the issue, since the resulting
<br />
netCDF file could be translated into an XML form such as NcML or any
<br />
other lossless representation that would still have a redundant copy
<br />
of the shared grid_mapping information for each variable defined on
<br />
the same grid.  Duplication of information can be beneficial when it
<br />
prevents errors, as in declaring variable types even when the type of
<br />
the variable may be inferred from its usage.  But the minor
<br />
convenience of keeping a copy of the information in text form close to
<br />
each variable is of dubious value compared to the redundancy, identity
<br />
issues, potential inconsistency (update anomalies), insertion
<br />
anomalies, and deletion anomalies this design permits.
<br />
<br />Identity issues:  Is the mapping for T given by
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;T:grid_mapping=&quot;rotated_latitude_longitude &quot;,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grid_north_pole_latitude: nplat grid_north_pole_longitude: nplon&quot;;
<br />
<br />the same as the mapping for S specified with
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;S:grid_mapping=&quot;rotated_latitude_longitude &quot;,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grid_north_pole_longitude: nplon grid_north_pole_latitude: nplat&quot;;
<br />
<br />?  The only difference is in the order of the (keyword: value) pairs,
<br />
which shouldn't be significant, but it's difficult for a human reader
<br />
to tell these are the same, and the difficulty of comparing them for a
<br />
human increases with the square of the number of keywords.  You could
<br />
define a canonical form for each grid_mapping, perhaps requiring that
<br />
the keywords appear in alphabetical order, but this added complexity
<br />
is not needed when grid_mappings are identified just by having the
<br />
same name for the attribute.
<br />
<br />This also occurs in merging information from two files, where the
<br />
variables may use the same grid mapping represented by keywords in
<br />
different orders.  Using a single variable to represent a grid mapping
<br />
doesn't have this problem, since it is easy to compare two variables
<br />
to see if they have the same attributes.
<br />
<br />Potential inconsistency:  If you update a value in some grid_mappings but
<br />
not in others, an inconsistency results which is not possible if the
<br />
information is only stored in one place.
<br />
<br />Insertion anomalies: There is no place to store a grid_mapping if it
<br />
does not currently apply to at least one variable in the dataset.  But
<br />
it might be useful to insert a grid_mapping even when there are no
<br />
variables that use it, either for later use or to record alternate
<br />
grid_mappings.  Providing a template dataset with a set of
<br />
grid_mappings but no variables is also not possible if grid_mappings
<br />
cannot exist independent from variables.  The alternative of using a
<br />
variable for a grid_mapping doesn't have this problem.
<br />
<br />Deletion anomalies: The inverse of insertion anomalies is that if you
<br />
delete all the variables that use a particular grid_mapping, you may
<br />
lose information about the grid_mapping as well.  This may not be a
<br />
concern, but I can imagine it might be easier to create some new
<br />
variables on a grid by starting with an existing dataset, copying all
<br />
information except the existing variables, and then adding the new
<br />
variables.  This is more difficult if the grid_mappings are only
<br />
associated with the variables.
<br />
<br />Finally, the design with a single variable representing a grid_mapping
<br />
is more flexible, because you can later attach more information to the
<br />
grid_mapping without affecting working programs.  For example, if you
<br />
wanted to later associate a &quot;french_name&quot; with each grid_mapping,
<br />
adding it to the string would require changing the string parsers.
<br />
But adding an additional attribute to the variable would require no
<br />
changes to existing programs.  Since they don't know about the extra
<br />
information, they aren't affected by it.
<br />
<br />These arguments are similar to the reasons database designers use
<br />
&quot;normal forms&quot; in designing relational database schema.
<br />
<br />If you have similarly redundant designs for cell_measures,
<br />
cell_methods, and formula_terms, I would argue that these should
<br />
likewise be factored out into a separate named variable, with
<br />
indirection used to eliminate redundancy, for the same reasons as in
<br />
the grid_mapping case.

<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here's a hopefully clearer restatement of why I prefer a single attribute for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the grid_mapping, as currently proposed in CF-beta. If I can't convince you,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'll go along with the majority, of course - perhaps kicking and screaming. :-)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But as a result of thinking about this, I have a new proposal - see below.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (1) Readability of the CDL file. I want to have the projection information in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the same place as the variable definition, rather than somewhere else. A single
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attribute is a string of a few lines at most, and I think that is easy to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; understand and much more informative than a name for the mapping, which then
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; has to be looked up somewhere else. Brian is right that the names themselves
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; might be meaningful, but if they are generated by models according to their own
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; diverse conventions it is quite likely they won't be. It can't be guaranteed.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (2) Simplicity and self-consistency of the standard. We have used &quot;keyword:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; value&quot; type attributes for cell_measures, cell_methods and formula_terms, so it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would be consistent to do so for this purpose. We have to be able to parse such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attributes already. We can and should provide parsers in, say, Fortran, C and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Python at least. I agree there is a problem with parsing numerical values. (See
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my suggestion below.) I do not like the idea of introducing a new kind of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; variable and defining a large number of new kinds of attribute that could only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be used for this kind of variable. It is a lot of new machinery.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (3) I prefer per-variable information to global information because it's easier
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for programs to manipulate when modifying individual variables and combining
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; files. This is also generally the approach we have taken in CF. If you have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; global information, you have to break the association before you can change an
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; individual variable, and you have to test for identical information on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; variables from different sources when you combine files. On the other hand,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; doing a global change to lots of identical per-variable information is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; generally easy. Duplication per se is not a problem in this case. Duplication
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is a problem if you require data in different places to remain consistent. We
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do not require this for variables with grid mappings. You can't modify such a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; variable just by changing its grid mapping info - you have to produce a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; completely new variable anyway.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (4) Telling differences by inspection. I agree with Brian that it would not be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; easy to tell from inspection of a CDL file whether the coordinates were the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; same if they were all per-variable, so I admit that space-saving is not the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only reason for factoring out coordinates. But coordinates are usually *much*
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more voluminous than the grid mapping attribute. It *is* easy to compare grid
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mappings by inspection, just like units, standard_name and all the other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; metadata we don't factor out.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here's my suggestion to avoid parsing numbers. This actually amounts to a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; half-way house between our proposals so far.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   variables:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     float nplat;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     float nplon;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     float T(lev,rlat,rlon);
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       T:units=&quot;K&quot;;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;       T:grid_mapping=&quot;rotated_latitude_longitude &quot;,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         grid_north_pole_latitude: nplat grid_north_pole_longitude: nplon&quot;;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   data:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     nplat=32.5;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     nplon=170.0;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Referring to my points above:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (1) Readability. Partially satisfied. The data variable states what kind the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mapping is and what parameters it has. Unfortunately you do have to look
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; elsewhere for their values. These values could be grouped together by giving
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the variables similar names (like nplat and nplon).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (2) Simplicity and self-consistency. On these grounds it is better even than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; CF-beta. The grid_mapping attribute is now text-only and points to other
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; variables, which is exactly like cell_methods, formula_terms, etc. It does not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; introduce any new attributes. The numerical values are in variables of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; right numerical type so there is no problem with conversion.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (3) Per-variable information. Satisfied. It is easy to modify an individual
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; variable's mapping, but it also easy to modify a mapping's parameter globally,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so it seems to have the best of both worlds.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (4) Differences by inspection. Partially satisfied - as much as it is in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; projection-variable approach. You can't say for sure whether the parameters are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; different until you look at their values, but you can have a good guess.
