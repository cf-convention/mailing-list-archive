Dear Brian, Bob, John, Russ
<br />
<br />Here's a hopefully clearer restatement of why I prefer a single attribute for
<br />
the grid_mapping, as currently proposed in CF-beta. If I can't convince you,
<br />
I'll go along with the majority, of course - perhaps kicking and screaming. :-)
<br />
But as a result of thinking about this, I have a new proposal - see below.
<br />
<br />(1) Readability of the CDL file. I want to have the projection information in
<br />
the same place as the variable definition, rather than somewhere else. A single
<br />
attribute is a string of a few lines at most, and I think that is easy to
<br />
understand and much more informative than a name for the mapping, which then
<br />
has to be looked up somewhere else. Brian is right that the names themselves
<br />
might be meaningful, but if they are generated by models according to their own
<br />
diverse conventions it is quite likely they won't be. It can't be guaranteed.
<br />
<br />(2) Simplicity and self-consistency of the standard. We have used &quot;keyword:
<br />
value&quot; type attributes for cell_measures, cell_methods and formula_terms, so it
<br />
would be consistent to do so for this purpose. We have to be able to parse such
<br />
attributes already. We can and should provide parsers in, say, Fortran, C and
<br />
Python at least. I agree there is a problem with parsing numerical values. (See
<br />
my suggestion below.) I do not like the idea of introducing a new kind of
<br />
variable and defining a large number of new kinds of attribute that could only
<br />
be used for this kind of variable. It is a lot of new machinery.
<br />
<br />(3) I prefer per-variable information to global information because it's easier
<br />
for programs to manipulate when modifying individual variables and combining
<br />
files. This is also generally the approach we have taken in CF. If you have
<br />
global information, you have to break the association before you can change an
<br />
individual variable, and you have to test for identical information on
<br />
variables from different sources when you combine files. On the other hand,
<br />
doing a global change to lots of identical per-variable information is
<br />
generally easy. Duplication per se is not a problem in this case. Duplication
<br />
is a problem if you require data in different places to remain consistent. We
<br />
do not require this for variables with grid mappings. You can't modify such a
<br />
variable just by changing its grid mapping info - you have to produce a
<br />
completely new variable anyway.
<br />
<br />(4) Telling differences by inspection. I agree with Brian that it would not be
<br />
easy to tell from inspection of a CDL file whether the coordinates were the
<br />
same if they were all per-variable, so I admit that space-saving is not the
<br />
only reason for factoring out coordinates. But coordinates are usually *much*
<br />
more voluminous than the grid mapping attribute. It *is* easy to compare grid
<br />
mappings by inspection, just like units, standard_name and all the other
<br />
metadata we don't factor out.
<br />
<br />Here's my suggestion to avoid parsing numbers. This actually amounts to a
<br />
half-way house between our proposals so far.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;variables:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;float nplat;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;float nplon;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;float T(lev,rlat,rlon);
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T:units=&quot;K&quot;;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T:grid_mapping=&quot;rotated_latitude_longitude &quot;,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grid_north_pole_latitude: nplat grid_north_pole_longitude: nplon&quot;;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;data:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nplat=32.5;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nplon=170.0;
<br />
<br />Referring to my points above:
<br />
<br />(1) Readability. Partially satisfied. The data variable states what kind the
<br />
mapping is and what parameters it has. Unfortunately you do have to look
<br />
elsewhere for their values. These values could be grouped together by giving
<br />
the variables similar names (like nplat and nplon).
<br />
<br />(2) Simplicity and self-consistency. On these grounds it is better even than
<br />
CF-beta. The grid_mapping attribute is now text-only and points to other
<br />
variables, which is exactly like cell_methods, formula_terms, etc. It does not
<br />
introduce any new attributes. The numerical values are in variables of the
<br />
right numerical type so there is no problem with conversion.
<br />
<br />(3) Per-variable information. Satisfied. It is easy to modify an individual
<br />
variable's mapping, but it also easy to modify a mapping's parameter globally,
<br />
so it seems to have the best of both worlds.
<br />
<br />(4) Differences by inspection. Partially satisfied - as much as it is in the
<br />
projection-variable approach. You can't say for sure whether the parameters are
<br />
different until you look at their values, but you can have a good guess.
<br />
<br />What do you think?
<br />
<br />Cheers
<br />
<br />Jonathan
