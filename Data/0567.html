<br />
Dear All,
<br />
<br />I've been the lead author of the CF conventions since December 1999 when
<br />
Karl Taylor encouraged Jonathan Gregory, Bob Drach, and me to consider
<br />
merging the GDT and NCAR-CSM metadata conventions which were independent
<br />
extensions of the COARDS conventions.  Not too long after that we were able
<br />
to entrain Steve Hankin into the discussions.  This effort has never
<br />
received any official support, and consequently moved forward slowly, but
<br />
surely until the release of CF-1.0 in October of 2003.
<br />
<br />Since then I'm afraid things have proceded even more slowly and less
<br />
surely.  As Bryan pointed out in the subgrid variation thread there is no
<br />
CF-2.0 draft document that contains the proposals that have been discussed
<br />
and generally agreed on in this mail list over the past year.  Since the
<br />
release of CF-1.0 my job responsibilities have changed substantially and I
<br />
find that I no longer have the time to devote to moving CF forward.  As any
<br />
benevolent dictator in my shoes would do, I will step aside as the lead
<br />
author as soon as someone else is ready to assume that role.  Until that
<br />
time I will continue to maintain the CF home page, making sure the links
<br />
all work and so on.
<br />
<br />I'd like to thank Bryan for his efforts to move CF forward.  I feel
<br />
confident that things are moving in a good direction and look forward to
<br />
participating in future discussions.
<br />
<br />Sincerely,
<br />
Brian

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hi Folks
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sorry about the long silence. Those who know me, will know I have strong 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; opinions about a number of the things being discussed recently, so you'll 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; also know that the fact I haven't been replying is due to other pressures. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Anyway, I'm out from under for a while ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'll comment on a number of other threads shortly, but firstly I wanted to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; expose some ideas some of us have about the future of CF.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Firstly, I think we'll all agree that CF is evolving.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Secondly, I suspect most of us are having trouble holding the various threads 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of activity in our heads, and the current status of those threads.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Thirdly, the CF authors, who are our benevolent dictators (using a phrase 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; beloved of the programme language community), have all at one time or another 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; expressed that they can't cope (quickly enough) either ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Fourthly, anyone attempting to write code based on CF is faced with a standard 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that is getting harder and harder to interpret
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Fifthly (stop numbering everything Bryan), the standard name vocabulary is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; becoming unwieldy in and of itself to manage
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sixthly (I failed to stop :-), CF is becoming so important it is having to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interoperate with other communities (e.g. GIS, of which more in a later 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; email) ...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You get the picture. I could have written more.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So what can we do about it?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; One of the things I think we need is a methodology which is more sophisticated 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than a mailing list to keep track of threads and discussions. Things need to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be marked as live, or forgotten, or under action, or going into a future 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; VERSION of CF.  OK, one of my cards on the table: we need version control! We 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; also need a mechanism of making a decision about what's happening, and we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; need more status information.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &lt;We&gt; needs to be defined. In my mind &lt;we&gt; is the entire CF community. Well, we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all know how efficient a committee is at building things, so a mailing list 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in and of itself doesn't make decisions... arguably CF is successful because 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we have a decision making process (the CF authors have final say). But for 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; how long can they keep that up? If we want to change things, how could we 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; change them? What happens when the CF authors interests start to diverge from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the community of CF users?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would argue we need a community process, perhaps including an elected 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; committee, perhaps including the right of veto from the CF authors (or some 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; trusted group of folk). There are lots of options. This email isn't so much 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; about what we do, as about suggesting a strategy to coming up with a process.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (And, we need a standards track. We need CF to become more than a community 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; standard, we would like WMO to take it on board etc ... if that happened, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; then we really do have an incentive for writing code which understands and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exploits CF.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Anyway, back to the strategy. So what should that strategy be? Some of you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will know of the Global-Organisation for Earth System Science Portals 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (GO-ESSP, see <a href="http://go-essp.gfdl.noaa.gov/">http://go-essp.gfdl.noaa.gov/</a>). We have a meeting in June, in 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the UK, and on the agenda we will have a discussion of the future of CF. All 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the CF authors except Brian can and will make it. (Meeting details at: 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; <a href="http://go-essp.gfdl.noaa.gov/news_meetings.html">http://go-essp.gfdl.noaa.gov/news_meetings.html</a>).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; On the table will be some real support for CF activities rather than 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; best-effort activities. I expect (but wont be able to confirm til June) to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have 50% of an FTE on CF support at the BADC from April 2006. It would be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nice if we could find some other players who can commit some real effort to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; making this work. Having done that we obviously need a mechanism to make sure 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; those of us managing and funding the effort are doing what the community 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; wants, rather than what we want alone (if we did the latter, we'd be wasting 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the effort).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Obviously not everyone who cares can come to that meeting, and many of those 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; who care wont want to come because CF is only a small part of the agenda. So 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it will be important for us to canvas opinion via this email list before that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; meeting.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So, this long email is by way of foreshadowing (and perhaps engendering) what 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I hope will be some vociferous discussion of how we take CF forward. I think 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we all agree that it is important, and I hope we can find some consensus on a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mechanism for community maintenance of CF that maintains the existing rigor 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (spelt like an American to show how International I can be :-), but is easier 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for the community to use and evolve. (For evolve we must :-)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Discuss :-)
