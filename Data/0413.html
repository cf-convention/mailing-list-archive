Hi Folks
<br />
<br />Sorry that it has taken me so long  to enter into this ... I've got a lot on 
<br />
this week ... but I felt I had to say something now :-). Apologies for the 
<br />
length of this email, but I dont have time to write anything short. I guess 
<br />
those of you who care will read on ... :-)
<br />
<br />There are a number of threads bumping around here:
<br />
<br />- splitting CF from the standard nametable
<br />
and dealing with who is responsible for the name table(s)
<br />
- deciding what we mean by standard names
<br />
- dealing with evolving the nametable(s)
<br />
<br />In part these all these are driven by the recognition that CF is becoming a 
<br />
defacto standard for more than just the climate community that spawned it, 
<br />
and my comments should be seen in that light.  
<br />
<br />Firstly, splitting CF from the standard name table: I think this is crucial 
<br />
for many reasons:
<br />
&nbsp;- we need to version CF name table versions far more frequently than the rest 
<br />
of CF.
<br />
&nbsp;- we need to establish a governance framework for the standard names that is 
<br />
different from the rest of CF.
<br />
<br />I think the latter is important, because, without belittling the huge efforts 
<br />
of the existing CF authors, if the standard names are to become more widely 
<br />
used than amongst the climate modelling community there has to be a visible 
<br />
mechanism by which those wider communities can influence (even control) the 
<br />
name evolution.
<br />
<br />I've argued before that a mechanism to achieve that would be so spawn a new 
<br />
mailing list (CF_NAMES?, to which anyone interested could subscribe (possibly 
<br />
a start on the forum Roy has suggested we need?). New name proposals could be 
<br />
discussed there and possibly voted on. We could nominate some individuals to 
<br />
have a veto to ensure that democracy didn't overturn logic. Obvious 
<br />
individuals for that &quot;security council&quot; for CF names could include the 
<br />
existing CF authors if they so desired, but there might be other folk with 
<br />
the time and expertise to be involved (Roy Lowry springs to mind).
<br />
<br />Secondly: what does the word &quot;standard&quot; mean in the phrase standard names? I 
<br />
think it means that it's something that we hope has precision and longevity, 
<br />
but I also note that different communities adopt different standards for good 
<br />
reasons, and no community is really in a position to adopt the moral high 
<br />
ground and claim precedence. &quot;Our&quot; standard name table had better recognise 
<br />
that it will live in a world of multiple namespaces, and support the concept, 
<br />
even if we want to encourage folk to use our namespace as much as possible.
<br />
<br />Thirdly: How do we deal with evolution of the namespace, and how do we allow 
<br />
communities to evolve their existing namespaces into ours? Clearly we need to 
<br />
avoid proliferation (I agree with everything  said on this topic already) but 
<br />
there is no way I think the existing CF community should be ruling on (for 
<br />
example) a chemistry name space ... but nonetheless we already have to deal 
<br />
with a limited (and growing) subset of relevant chemistry in atmospheric 
<br />
chemistry models.
<br />
<br />I think the xml and xml-schema based suggestions for CF 1.X are very helpful, 
<br />
I do not think we should be trying to fit everything into one flat namespace. 
<br />
By analogy: we do need a dictionary interface, but we need compound words and 
<br />
we need thesauri to build the complexity of names we need if we expand out of 
<br />
the o(100) variables one needs in a climate model.
<br />
<br />So, to Jonathan's specific points: 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; (0) We retain the existing arrangement for adding standard name as proposed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the email list, which should be adequate in many cases involving only a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; few new standard names.
</em><br />
<br />I think we should have a new mailing list, dedicated to naming issues.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; (1) Projects wanting to develop their own list of standard names should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; produce xml tables with the same schema as the central table (containing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; standard name, canonical units, description).
</em><br />
<br />I agree we should establish a standard syntax, whether or not this is the 
<br />
right one is not my call.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; (2) Each such project should have a unique name, and the project tables
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should be linked with those names from the CF home page (like conventions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of netCDF). That means the project tables will all be public.
</em><br />
<br />We need a registry of standard name tables as suggested by Pieter Haaring, 
<br />
probably initially at NCAR (or we would do it if they didn't want to) but 
<br />
eventually hosted by an appropriate international body.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; (3) Project tables should avoid including new names for quantities which
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; already have standard names in the central tables or in any of the existing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; project tables.
</em><br />
<br />Projects should try very hard to identify synonyms in other tables, but I 
<br />
think it will be an SEP (Somebody Elses Problem) to work on ontological 
<br />
mappings between these tables. Clearly we need to start work on ensuring the 
<br />
terms we use in our descriptions are themselves from a controlled vocabulary.
<br />
(this would have helped us a lot with our discussions over omega :-)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt; (4) Names in the project table which are not in the central table should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have a prefix of the name of the project which defined them. One possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; syntax would be, for instance, &quot;my_project/my_standard_name&quot;. There would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be no need for an attribute in the netCDF file to identify the standard
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; name table, as the project name will refer to a table which is linked from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the CF website. That makes the files more &quot;future-proof&quot; (since URLs often
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; change).
</em><br />
<br />If we use namespaces correctly, we should be able to avoid the URL problem, we 
<br />
could even, if we wanted, use some of the PURL or DOI technology from the 
<br />
digital library community. Actually,  I think we should appeal for help from 
<br />
that community, because this is not something where we should reinvent 
<br />
wheels.
<br />
<br />There are some other namespaces which ought to take precedence - for example, 
<br />
geographical names and their meanings should come straight from an ISO 
<br />
standard (someone remind me which one :-) ... and we shouldn't make decisions 
<br />
about what parts of someone else's namespace we want to include ... for 
<br />
example, I understand the reasons why country names were not included in CF 
<br />
included problems of discontinuity and permanence, but to be inclusive we 
<br />
have to include such things (and can deal with permanace with clear 
<br />
versioning). 
<br />
<br />Well, that's probably enough for now ... congrats to anyone who has read this 
<br />
far ...
<br />
<br />Bryan
