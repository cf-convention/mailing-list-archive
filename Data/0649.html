John,
<br />
<br />Your comments are very useful to fuel the CF debate. I just wanted to pick up the station and trajectory data question, and to add radar data to that list. I think that CF is becoming (or being used as) the standard for lots of these data types because it is the best option, even if it is still lacking. As you say, CF's strength is really gridded data, but unless there are other standards out there that can encompass station, trajectory and radar data then I'd rather CF worked harder to understand and fully include these data types. We have a radar group in the UK who have all switched to NetCDF so drawing on experience such as theirs would be a sensible way forward. Perhaps we need a working group on each of these data types with some interactions that would ensure they didn't diverge too radically.
<br />
<br />Kind regards,
<br />
<br />Ag
<br />

Subject: [CF-metadata] Thoughts about CF future
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Since I am not able to come to the GO-ESSP meeting to discuss these 
<br />
issues in person, I wanted to lay out my thoughts about where CF could 
<br />
go in the future. These are personal opininions, and not in any way 
<br />
official Unidata positions.
<br />
<br />We (Unidata) have been pushing CF as the recommended way to write 
<br />
gridded files to anyone who asks. We have had a lot of success, 
<br />
including with ESRI who are working on reading CF compliant netdf files 
<br />
into ArcView. CF has really done a great job of clarifying the semantics 
<br />
of data.  In my view, the current edges of CF that need work are:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. staggered grids, eg as output by the WRF model.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. need to specify very detailed info as used by GIS, for example, 
<br />
ellipsoids and datums etc.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. ongoing need to add new projections and vertical coordinate types
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. ongoing need to develop standard names and hook these into other 
<br />
ontologies
<br />
<br />My primary concern is creating a process for evolving CF, what Bryan 
<br />
called &quot;governance&quot;. I would like to see a formal decision making group 
<br />
be identified, with super-majority but not necessarily unanimous consent 
<br />
required. I would also like to have ad-hoc subgroups form to work on 
<br />
special topics, for example &quot;Regional/local models&quot; and &quot;GIS&quot;. These 
<br />
subgroups would work out a concrete recommendation, then submit to the 
<br />
entire group for feedback and eventually a decision by the governance group.
<br />
<br />Another issue that has recently come up: CF has a small section about 
<br />
both Station and Trajectory data, that is good as far as it goes, but 
<br />
needs more semantics to be complete. I would recommend that CF restrict 
<br />
itself to gridded data, and withdraw the Station and Trajectory data 
<br />
sections. However, if there is enough interest, i would recommend 
<br />
forming a subgroup that would finish specifying it.
<br />
<br />There is also development at Unidata that effects CF, most notably the 
<br />
&quot;coordinate system&quot; object model, prototyped in the Netcdf-Java library 
<br />
(which we may also add to the Netcdf-4 library). This parses CF 
<br />
conventions (among others) and presents a unified coordinate system API 
<br />
to the user. We also are working on &quot;scientific data type&quot; APIs that so 
<br />
far include Grid, Point, Station, Trajectory and Radial data types. This 
<br />
work is not as far along as the coordinate systems, but as part of it we 
<br />
have been evolving our view of what makes good file formats in those cases.
<br />
<br />Whatever is decided, we will continue to support CF as an important 
<br />
semantic description of data. I appreciate all the time and intelligence 
<br />
this group continues to provide.
