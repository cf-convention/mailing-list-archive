New standard name table for the CF netCDF convention
<br />
<br />Under the CF metadata home page <a href="http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cms/eaton/cf-metadata/">http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/cms/eaton/cf-metadata/</a>
<br />
we have posted a new version of the CF standard name table. (The standard name
<br />
table specifies standardized names for distinct physical quantities, as
<br />
described in section 3.3 of the CF convention.) The first draft was originally
<br />
posted early in 2001, but few comments were received until 2002. In the new
<br />
version, we have made extensive changes to take these comments into account, in
<br />
particular to use shorter names where possible and to adopt more usual
<br />
phraseology.
<br />
<br />In the two years since the draft was published, users of the CF convention may
<br />
have begun to use the draft standard names. We have therefore also provided an
<br />
equivalence table to the new names for those which have changed. We also
<br />
describe the changes and the reasons for them. For simplicity, we would like to
<br />
regard the superseded names as obsolete. However, in cases where this would
<br />
cause you great inconvenience, we could define the old names to be aliases for
<br />
the replacement ones. A mechanism to do this has already been proposed in the
<br />
CF convention.  Please post to the CF-metadata group stating which superseded
<br />
names you would like to be retained.
<br />
<br />We propose that all standard names in the table on 31 January 2003 will be
<br />
permanently valid. None will be made obsolete after that date. Future changes
<br />
will require aliases to be introduced for backwards compatibility.
<br />
<br />The new standard name document provides explanatory comments for many standard
<br />
names. We have also supplied tables of equivalences to PCMDI variable names and
<br />
ECMWF and NCEP GRIB codes. These other parameter lists specify some quantities
<br />
which for a complete definition require metadata in addition to the
<br />
standard_name, as shown in the equivalence tables. The equivalences for the
<br />
NCEP private GRIB codes (&gt;127) have not yet been included, and there are a few
<br />
other holes that will be filled. We will shortly propose a standardized method
<br />
for distinguishing between an annual and a decadal standard deviation, which is
<br />
needed in the PCMDI table and will be more generally useful. It would be very
<br />
helpful if those familiar with PCMDI, ECMWF or NCEP conventions could check the
<br />
equivalences which have been completed. In addition, we would welcome answers
<br />
to the questions appended, which show our ignorance and/or the lack of clarity
<br />
in the parameter tables!
<br />
<br />According to the CF convention, the primary definition of the standard name
<br />
table is given in XML. The XML version will be made available soon.
<br />
<br />Thanks to all for comments on the CF conventions. Continued discussion is most
<br />
welcome.  Happy New Year.

<br />Jonathan Gregory and Brian Eaton
<br />
<br /><br />* Is pseudoadabatic potential temperature the same thing as pseudoequivalent
<br />
potential temperature?
<br />
<br />* What is Montgomery streamfunction (GRIB code 37)?
<br />
<br />* What is the distinction between absolute and relative divergence (GRIB codes
<br />
42 and 44)?
<br />
<br />* Are GRIB codes 15 and 16 *daily* max and min temperature, as we have
<br />
assumed? If not daily, then what?
<br />
<br />* Is vorticity (ECMWF GRIB code 138) relative or absolute?
<br />
<br />* Is log surface pressure (ECMWF GRIB code 152) natural or common log? In what
<br />
units is the pressure?
<br />
<br />* Is there a quantitative definition of &quot;deep soil&quot; in ECMWF GRIB codes 170,
<br />
171, 183 and 184?
<br />
<br />* In view of the note to the GRIB table which reads &quot;Net (vertical) fluxes
<br />
shall be calculated by subtracting the downward flux values from the upward
<br />
flux values&quot; we have assumed that they are positive upward. Is this correct?
<br />
<br />* What is ICAO standard atmosphere reference height (NCEP GRIB code 5)?
<br />
<br />* What are the parcel and best lifted indexes (NCEP GRIB codes 24 and 77)?
<br />
<br />* NCEP GRIB code 89 is &quot;density&quot; of what?
<br />
<br />* What are the precise definitions of the radar spectra (GRIB codes 21-23),
<br />
wave spectra (28-30), thermocline depths (68-70), primary and second wave
<br />
directions and periods (107-110), image data (127), atmospheric tide (128) and
<br />
budget values (129)?
<br />
<br />* What is the difference between PCMDI variables cl &quot;cloud amount&quot; and clt
<br />
&quot;total cloud amount&quot;?
<br />
<br />* What is PCMDI variable mrsofcs &quot;surface soil moisture field capacity&quot; a
<br />
percentage of?
<br />
<br />* Are PCMDI net radiative fluxes upward or downward? We have assumed upward.
<br />
<br />* What is the &quot;model top&quot; in PCMDI variable rtmt? In what way is it different
<br />
from TOA?
