Dear All
<br />
<br />Three schemes are being discussed:
<br />
<br />* CF-beta. A per-data-variable attribute which contains the names of the
<br />
mapping, the parameters and their values.
<br />
<br />* Caron-Rew. A string variable naming the mapping, with special attributes to
<br />
define its parameters, referred to by name from a per-data-variable attribute.
<br />
<br />* Gregory. A per-data-variable attribute which contains the names of the
<br />
mapping, the parameters and the variables containing the parameter values. This
<br />
avoids the awkwardness that Bob raised of having to get numerical values from
<br />
strings.
<br />
<br />Readability and telling differences by inspection: It is clear from the
<br />
discussion that these issues are matters of personal preference, since we
<br />
disagree on what's convenient for a human (I believe we are all human). Hence
<br />
we can't use these factors as a basis for decision.
<br />
<br />Simplicity: My concern about lots of new attributes is the same as Karl's -
<br />
it makes the standard more complicated. For the same reason I do not like
<br />
introducing a new &quot;kind&quot; of variable for the sake of something to attach these
<br />
attributes to.
<br />
<br />The main area of disagreement is the desirability of factoring out duplicated
<br />
information. There are several aspects to this.
<br />
<br />(a) Testing whether variables have the same grid mapping. In the Caron-Rew
<br />
scheme you can conclude they do have the same mapping if they have the same
<br />
mapping name. But there might be two mappings with identical definitions. This
<br />
could happen if you assemble a file from several files. It could happen for
<br />
example if a model unconditionally creates separate mapping variables for the
<br />
velocity and mass grids. To prevent this happening you would have to place a
<br />
requirement on the data-writer always to check whether mappings are the same
<br />
and eliminate duplicates whenever a file is created. If you cannot guarantee
<br />
that mappings are unique, you have to test whether they are the same by
<br />
comparing parameters. If you *ever* have to be able to do this, you need
<br />
software to do it, and I argue that this advantage of factoring out the mapping
<br />
has then essentially been lost. You may as well always compare the mappings
<br />
parameter by parameter. It's more reliable that way.
<br />
<br />(b) Order of parameters in a single attribute. We disagree about how easy this
<br />
is for a human to deal with, but for a program it is surely not an issue. A
<br />
program can scan the attribute repeatedly to find the parameters, regardless of
<br />
their order. The parser need not be bothered by the introduction of new
<br />
parameters it doesn't recognise - it can just ignore them by skipping forward
<br />
to the next keyword.
<br />
<br />(c) Potential inconsistency if each variable has its own mapping definition.
<br />
In my scheme, this is partly avoided, because the different data variables can
<br />
share the parameter variables. However, I really would appreciate an example
<br />
which illustrates the concern with potential inconsistency. I don't think that
<br />
a per-data-variable attribute *is* truly duplicating information. Each variable
<br />
has its *own* grid mapping, though they may all happen to be the same. In the
<br />
Caron-Rew scheme and in my scheme you can change the value of a mapping
<br />
parameter for all data variables which share a mapping by altering a single
<br />
number. In the Caron-Rew scheme you can change the mapping itself (e.g. from
<br />
rotated pole to polar stereographic). But in what situation would you actually
<br />
want to do this by a global operation (except to correct a mistake)? Changing
<br />
the mapping means entirely recomputing the variable; it must have a new grid
<br />
and new data values. You have to do this on each variable separately. It is not
<br />
a global operation.
<br />
<br />Because of (a-c), I don't think that factoring out the information gives any
<br />
great advantage, but I do think that to do it this way involves significantly
<br />
more work for the data-writer and is more complicated for the user of the
<br />
standard. So I still prefer CF-beta or my modified form of it.
<br />
<br />Apart from these, there is a final, completely different issue which Russ
<br />
raises under &quot;deletion anomalies&quot;, that the mapping can't exist if no variables
<br />
use it, in the case of a per-data-variable approach. Brian has raised a similar
<br />
issue in the past regarding auxiliary coordinate variables, which look just
<br />
like data variables if they are by themselves in a file. I feel this is a
<br />
different thing altogether. Do we want to be able to have &quot;grids&quot; (whatever we
<br />
might mean by that :-)) which exist independently of data variables? This is a
<br />
philosophical design point. CF has not tried to accommodate that idea up to
<br />
now. The aim of the standard is to provide metadata for data which exists, not
<br />
to provide metadata which could describe some data not yet provided.
<br />
<br />I would say that this is a more general than grid mappings. If we want to do
<br />
this, I would propose we introduce something like the Caron-Rew idea, but for
<br />
all grid information. I'd call this an &quot;abstract variable&quot;.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;dimensions:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x=73;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;y=96;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pressure=10;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;p_len=50;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nb=2;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nv=4;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;variables:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;char abstractvariable(p_len);
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;abstractvariable:grid_mapping=&quot;rotated_latitude_longitude &quot;,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;grid_north_pole_latitude: nplat grid_north_pole_longitude: nplon&quot;;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;abstractvariable:coordinates=&quot;lat lon&quot;;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;float x(x);
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x:bounds=&quot;x_bounds&quot;;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;float x_bounds(x,nb);
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;float y(y);
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;float lat(y,x);
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lat:bounds=&quot;lat_bounds&quot;;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;float lat_bounds(y,x,nv);
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;float lon(y,x);
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;data:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;abstractvariable=&quot;x y pressure&quot;;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nplon=170.0;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nplat=32.5;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lat=...;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lon=...;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x=...;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;y=...;
<br />
<br />This is an entirely data-free variable. Its string value tells us its
<br />
dimensions, and it provides a home for the mapping, coordinates, auxiliary
<br />
coordinates and their boundaries. Its name could be taken as a name for this
<br />
grid as a whole. However, I'm not advocating this as a solution to the
<br />
practical problem of how to define the grid_mapping, but as a proposal to
<br />
consider if we want to introduce this more abstract kind of object as an
<br />
additional feature.
<br />
<br />Have a good weekend. Cheers
<br />
<br />Jonathan
